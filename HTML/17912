      I am happy because last Tuesday I reached a milestone I had been looking forward to. I wore the heels again that I had broken my ankle in. Others have told me to throw them away, it’s too risky, why would I want to keep them. But they were one of my favorite pairs and they are probably the most sturdy. I would never have guessed that would be the pair involved in the fall. But it goes to show what a fluke it was; I really don’t think they were my main problem.
     </p>
     <p>
      I wore them for about 2-1/2 hours during a meeting at the Kingdom Hall. I was sitting most of that time, of course, but even while standing and walking, they felt great. I had no ankle pain or discomfort, and I walked normally. Although maybe I should have had someone film me so I could see from another perspective. It could be I’m walking like a lame giraffe and just can’t tell! LOL
     </p>
     <p>
      So I’m keeping the shoes and will wear them and other high heels again. My highest pair may have to go to Goodwill at some point, but I’m not ready to make that decision quite yet. When I try them on occasionally, I’m still like, Nope, these are not safe. And it may never be. But we’ll see.

      Hard to believe, but it has now been 6 months since I broke my ankle. It’s definitely time for an update!
     </p>
     <p>
      But first, a quick run-down on how our trip to Bulgaria was ankle-wise (this trip happened at about the 4-1/2 month mark). I’m copying part of this from my reply to a commenter on a previous post since it already explains how things went.
     </p>
     <p>
      To be honest, the trip was a lot tougher than I thought it would be, mainly due to the swelling. I’ve never seen my foot so big. Actually, they were both huge. My calves were hard as a rock and I couldn’t even feel my kneecaps. I blew out one of my sandal straps from the pressure against it. So I had to buy a really loose pair of flip-flops because I couldn’t get anything else on.
     </p>
     <p>
      It was pretty painful too. We did lots of walking and we were gone for full days, so I was only able to put my foot up when I went to bed. And it wasn’t enough to bring the swelling down to normal by morning. So each day my feet were a little bigger and a little more painful.
     </p>
     <p>
      Obviously, I had been overly optimistic about my readiness for the trip, but it was worth it. And I’m extremely grateful that I didn’t re-injure myself while there. The sidewalks in Bulgaria leave a bit to be desired; here’s what many of them look like:
     </p>
     <p>
      <a href="http://myorifankle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image85.jpg">
       <img width="300" height="200" alt="image85" src="http://myorifankle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image85-300x200.jpg" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-185" />
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      And the European women walk around in their sky-high heels on this stuff without even looking down!
     </p>
     <p>
      So overall, it didn’t go as well as I’d hoped but it didn’t keep me from having a good time. I had my pain pills with me and was able to get by with one per day because I didn’t have many left. I ignored the pain as best I could and just soaked up the experience.
      <img style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt=":)" src="http://myorifankle.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" />
     </p>
     <p>
      One benefit of the trip, though, is that when we got back and the swelling went down, I found my range of motion had improved rather significantly. I think it was like a week of intense physical therapy over there, with all that I was asking of my ankle on a daily basis!
     </p>
     <h3>
      As for now…
     </h3>
     <p>
      Now, at the 6-month mark, I feel like my recovery has stalled a bit. I’m getting around with sufficient function to do everyday tasks. But I’m not progressing the way I’d like. There’s more pain than there was before the trip, but maybe that’s because I’m stretching and exercising it more. I hope that’s all it is. I don’t really think anything is wrong; I’m just impatient.
     </p>
     <p>
      When I get up in the morning, it’s still pretty stiff. Of course, my whole body is, since I’m over the hill! But I have to go down the stairs one at a time, step-together, step-together, until it loosens up.
     </p>
     <p>
      I’m still getting shooting pains from time to time, although that’s getting more infrequent, thank goodness. After I’ve been on my feet a while, especially if I’m doing housework or have been walking around a lot, my heel and inner ankle get quite sore.
     </p>
     <p>
      Range of motion is probably 80-90% of normal if I really stretch it, but that doesn’t come without some pain. And it still swells considerably by mid-day and into the evening, which still frustrates me. I just can’t sit with my feet up very much if I want to make a living!
     </p>
     <p>
      So all in all, I guess I’m still progressing, albeit slowly. At least I can do most of my normal activities. There are a lot of people a lot worse off than me for a million different reasons, so I am grateful and try to focus on the positives.
     </p>
     <p>
      I’ll update again in a couple months or so or if anything new develops.

      Just a quick note to say that our long-awaited trip to Europe begins in 2 days, on Tuesday, when we drive to Chicago and get on the plane at 10:40 p.m.! As I’ve said before, I’m SO grateful that my injury was long enough ago that I was able to recover in time for this trip. I watched

       videos
      </a>
      that a woman named Geneva made when she broke hers on the actual EVE of her planned European trip, and my heart broke for her! This is not something you recover from quickly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Anyway, I have nothing new to report except for this trip, and I’ll check in after we get back to let you guys know how it went ankle-wise. The main problem I foresee is the swelling, which still plagues me as the day goes on. I really thought it would stop doing that by now. So I had to get a couple new pairs of shoes for the trip that I can get my fat foot into.
     </p>
     <p>
      I’m a little nervous about holding my husband and friends back because I’m not likely to be able to maintain the same pace they can. But I’ll do my best and make the most of it! Can’t wait!

      Today I had my final appointment with Dr. Rau unless I have problems in the future with any of the remaining 11 screws. They took one last set of x-rays, which he said looked good.
     </p>
     <p>
      He tested my range of motion, which is still improving. I admitted to him that I have not been going to physical therapy after that first appointment. My excuse is that I don’t have time. Friends tell me, “MAKE time,” and I definitely would if I felt like I wasn’t improving steadily on my own. I’m doing the exercises at home (although admittedly it’s hit and miss), and every day I feel like my ankle is a little bit better.
     </p>
     <p>
      I stopped using my crutches a few days after the second surgery, so almost a month ago now. About 3 weeks ago, I began going up stairs the old way, one foot per step as opposed to step-together, step-together. And in the last week, I’ve been able at times to go down stairs the same way, although that is definitely harder. My foot doesn’t flex enough to do it smoothly, but I generally feel strong enough and sturdy enough to walk down them the way I used to. Except in the morning. NOTHING about me is strong and sturdy in the morning.
      <img style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt=":)" src="http://myorifankle.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" />
      I even caught myself half running up the steps one day before I realized what I was doing. It was a pleasant surprise that I could do something like that again without even thinking about it.
     </p>
     <p>
      As far as pain goes, I have only needed a pain pill a couple times over the last 3 weeks. Sometimes my whole leg aches quite intensely. Other than the occasional stabbing pain in various places in my ankle and foot, which goes away in a minute or so without pharmaceutical help, I don’t have pain that’s actually IN my ankle. But I’m guessing that my body is adjusting to using that leg fully again, and those atrophied muscles are protesting.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the blogs I read about other people who had broken an ankle gave the estimated figure of 4 months to get back to a relatively normal life. That has held true for me. At 4 months was the point when I felt like I was functioning again at a fairly normal level. I’m by no means back to normal–I expect that it might be a full year or more before I feel completely recovered–but I’m able to do what I have to do. I still get tired more easily, but that’s slowly getting better too.
     </p>
     <p>
      I’ll continue to update this blog when there’s anything to report or at various time milestones. Feel free to request an update if I haven’t posted in a while!

      I got the staples out today. Everything looked good, but the nurse did say I was overdoing it because my foot was still quite swollen. I know that’s the case but I just have so much to do. There’s just no way I can spend hours with my foot up. I put it up when I can, but that’s only in the evening and overnight. My ankle looks pretty good in the mornings, but by evening it’s looking pretty bad.
     </p>
     <p>
      They told me to come back for one last x-ray and checkup in one month. I will update when that happens.

      This won’t be a long post because the surgery took place fairly quickly about mid-day yesterday, and everything went smoothly. Again I don’t remember even having the mask put on me; I just remember them strapping me down and then I was out. They reopened an inch or so of the old incision on the outer side. When they got in there, they found Torx screws rather than Phillips, but somebody ran and found the proper screwdriver and got the screws out, which they saved for me in a sterile plastic bag. I got five new staples to close the incision.
     </p>
     <p>
      I’m back to two crutches for a while but not doing too bad overall. The doc gave me some Percocet for pain relief, so now I feel like I have enough meds to take care of me while in Bulgaria in case I have a lot of pain. I can’t imagine it’s going to be pain-free, seeing as we’re going to be doing a lot of walking.
     </p>
     <p>
      I’ll update again when I have my next appointment.

      I saw the orthopedist taking over my care in Michigan yesterday, Dr. Rau. He was very nice and shared a lot more information with me than my previous doctor, such as actually showing me my x-rays and describing what he saw.
     </p>
     <p>
      He said they looked great in spite of something that kind of concerned me. There was still a significant gap showing in the spiral fracture near the top of the plate. He said the bone had healed at its origin near the bottom and most of the way up and the plate was holding the upper part together, so it was nothing to be concerned about. Here’s a really rough sketch of how it looked to me:
     </p>
     <p>
      <a href="http://myorifankle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bone.jpg">
       <img width="400" height="440" alt="bone" src="http://myorifankle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bone.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-161" />
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      But…I’m pretty sure he knows what he’s talking about, so I’m not going to worry. Too much. Hopefully it will eventually fill in…? I don’t know why there’s a gap in the first place—was it out of alignment somehow when it started healing? Was there a fragment that busted off and wasn’t put back together? I know I said he gave me a lot of information, but unfortunately I didn’t have the presence of mind to ask these specific questions at the time.
     </p>
     <h3>
      More surgery
     </h3>
     <p>
      The big takeaway from the visit, though, was that I need to have more surgery to remove the two long screws that go all the way from the fibula to the tibia. Dr. Bleday had said I wouldn’t need surgery unless the screws bothered me, but Dr. Rau disagrees. He said if we don’t take them out now (and 12 weeks is his usual timing for this), they WILL break, and then they will be a bear to get out but it would have to be done because they would cause problems in there, as you can imagine broken screws would.
     </p>
     <p>
      It isn’t scheduled for sure yet but they’re looking at June 8, only a week and a half away. The nurse gave me explicit instructions on preparing for surgery, such as which meds to take and when, which to hold off on, and how to scrub my leg and foot for the 5 days prior to surgery as MRSA precautions. She’s supposed to call in a few days with a definite date and time.
     </p>
     <p>
      It will be outpatient surgery, which is good; I won’t have to stay overnight or anything. He doesn’t think it will set me back too far in my recovery; the incision will be much smaller than before and he just has to back those two screws out and sew it up.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Weightbearing
     </h3>
     <p>
      In any case, I am now allowed to weightbear as tolerated! Yay! I’m still supposed to use one crutch most of the time, and I am doing so even though it’s a pain because I don’t want to risk breaking those screws before surgery. I have taken a few steps without the crutches, which they said was fine, but I’m being very, very careful.
     </p>
     <h3>
      New cast
     </h3>
     <p>
      They also gave me an air cast, so it’s bye-bye to the big black boot, which is great.
     </p>
     <p>
      <a href="http://myorifankle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/May-29-brace.jpg">
       <img width="400" height="300" alt="May-29-brace" src="http://myorifankle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/May-29-brace.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-163" />
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      So progress is still being made. We are going to Bulgaria in 7 weeks (yay, first trip overseas for us!) and I’m pretty sure I’ll be in decent shape by then. That has been one of my worries right from the start—would I be recovered enough to fly comfortably and do a lot of walking. I’m so glad this happened almost 5 months before the trip as opposed to now!

     <p>
      This past Thursday through Monday we were out of town for a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Green Bay, Wisconsin, which was the biggest outing I’ve had since this happened.
     </p>
     <p>
      I was concerned about how I would handle it due to my fatigue and swelling especially, but I was determined not to miss it; it’s always the highlight of the year for me. I wasn’t worried about the pain, and indeed it wasn’t too bad; I only had to take one pain pill per day. But I’ve been so exhausted lately I wasn’t sure I could do it.
     </p>
     <p>
      As it turned out, I was able to function pretty well by using the wheelchair for longer distances and crutches for shorter ones; that way I didn’t get too tired out. My sister and various other friends were there to push me around, which saved my arms as well. I could have used the wheelchair for everything, but I found that after sitting for too long, my sciatic nerves down the backs of my legs started screaming at me, and I had to stretch them by walking.
     </p>
     <p>
      The swelling was pretty significant each evening, and even today it’s not back to normal, but I’m sure it will be soon. My newly adjusted boot was comfortable even though I had it on for about 12 hours each day, although my leg was kind of hot and itchy and it felt good to get it off at night.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Bionic people
     </h3>
     <p>
      What I didn’t expect, though, was how many people are walking around with metal in their ankles! At the convention venue as well as in restaurants, stores, and the hotel, people were constantly coming up to me and expressing their sympathy, saying “I’ve been there!” or “I feel your pain!”
     </p>
     <p>
      My earlier research had told me that a broken ankle is a fairly common injury, but I didn’t grasp just how common. Each person who approached me told me his/her story, and we compared notes on plates and screws, incisions, physical therapy, and recovery times.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unfortunately, most said they still have ankle pain or stiffness to varying degrees, but I’m not going to worry about it. Pain has been a fairly constant companion for me since being diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 1996. So I can handle it.
     </p>
     <p>
      People have also been very kind. Waitresses seated us in booths nearest the door so I wouldn’t have to crutch too far. Both men and women held doors open for me. Friends that we knew at the convention offered their assistance with whatever I needed. I was really touched to know that compassion in this world isn’t entirely dead.
     </p>
     <p>
      I chatted with a man in a Goodwill store who had had the same experience, and one of the tips he gave me was to wear compression stockings to keep the swelling down. I thanked him and continued shopping. A few minutes later, another random guy approached me with a package of compression stockings in hand. He said he had overheard us talking and happened to notice a pair while he was looking around. Okay, I admit it sounds a little creepy. But I choose to believe it was a genuine gesture, and I didn’t get a bad vibe from him. Even though they were too small for me, it was nice of him to make that effort.
     </p>
     <p>
      Then as I checked out, the clerk told me she had broken her leg in 14 places falling on the ice. It must have been absolutely shattered! I was grateful it hadn’t been that bad for me.
     </p>
     <p>
      Anyway, the whole experience this weekend and throughout this ordeal has strengthened my determination to also be a “kind stranger” to others. Even little gestures can mean a lot to someone who is struggling with a physical or mental problem.
     </p>
     <p>
      Let’s keep “paying it forward.”

     <p>
      Finally started PT today, and it went quite well. Here’s the breakdown:
     </p>
     <h3>
      Crutch adjustment
     </h3>
     <p>
      The first thing the therapist did was adjust my crutches. I had the height about right but he moved the grip handles up a notch. He also demonstrated the proper way to walk with them, and it has made a big difference for me. I wasn’t hanging by the armpits or anything because I knew that was not right, although I did have bruises in that area at first just because I was unaccustomed to crutches, and I bruise easily anyway.
     </p>
     <p>
      What he helped me to change mostly was the way I was walking. I needed to stand up straighter and allow my left hip to “open up” as I stepped forward with my right. It was awkward at first but I soon got the hang of it. Now it feels like a much more natural motion. He said that doing it properly will really help me when I’m off the crutches to regain a natural walking manner, which is definitely what I want.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Actual therapy
     </h3>
     <p>
      He put my foot and toes through some gentle range-of-motion stretches with and without a big yellow rubber band (or whatever they call it) and I had no pain, although later that day it was a little sore. Not bad at all.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Boot adjustment
     </h3>
     <p>
      Then he tore my big black boot completely apart and reassembled it to fit my foot better. They hadn’t given me one iota of information about the boot when they put it on at the hospital, and they didn’t make any attempts to customize it to my foot and ankle. Just another small beef I have with the facility.
      <img style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt=":(" src="http://myorifankle.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" />
     </p>
     <p>
      When he was done, the boot was far more snug than it ever had been and yet super comfortable. My toes no longer stuck out the top. He also showed me how to pump up the little air “button” to mold it to my leg even more.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Lasers
     </h3>
     <p>
      He also had his student assistant give my ankle a laser treatment, which apparently stimulates the tissues for faster healing. It was painless.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Taping
     </h3>
     <p>
      Lastly, he put some Kinesio tape in a fan pattern on my ankle and calf, one in front and one in back. Here it is, the newest fashion in leg wear:
     </p>
     <p>
      <a href="http://myorifankle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/May-20-tape-1.jpg">
       <img width="400" height="300" alt="May-20-tape-1" src="http://myorifankle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/May-20-tape-1.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-152" />
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      <a href="http://myorifankle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/May-20-tape-2.jpg">
       <img width="300" height="400" alt="May-20-tape-2" src="http://myorifankle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/May-20-tape-2.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-153" />
      </a>
     </p>

      My understanding of this is that it speeds healing by pulling lightly at the skin as you move around, again, stimulating tissues and increasing blood flow. I guess it’s also supposed to help with pain and alignment of weak muscles. My therapist speaks with a heavy Polish accent, though, so I’m not 100% sure of any of this.

      All I know is that I look like a zebra. He told me to pat it dry after a shower and trim any parts that come loose. It is supposed to stay on for 3 to 5 days.

      Before I left, he said I probably only need to come in twice a week because my range of motion is quite good already. I was glad to hear that, especially since I don’t yet know whether my insurance will pay for it.

     <p>
      All in all, I am pleased with my first session and feeling like another milestone has been reached!

      Today, I thought I’d post on a lighter note about how much I miss my high heels! Because I was wearing heels when I got hurt, it might seem reasonable to get rid of anything higher than an inch or so, since I’m clearly too klutzy to live. But the fact is that in 35 or so years of wearing heels, this is the first time I’ve seriously hurt myself in them. I haven’t even had a sprain—nothing more than a slight twist that is sore for only a few minutes, and even that has been rare. This accident seemed to be a complete fluke.
     </p>
     <p>
      So I don’t plan on abandoning my heels. But it’ll be a while before I can wear them again. And I’ll probably be scared to at first. But I think I’ll be able to do it.
     </p>
     <p>
      I’m still wearing a heel on my right foot when I go to the Kingdom Hall, which results in a mismatch like this:

      Awesome, isn’t it? LOL

      Here’s a photo of about half my shoe collection, which I can’t wait to wear IN PAIRS, the way it was meant to be.

Because I know how much I appreciated reading about others who have gone through what I'm going through. By sharing our stories we can support and encourage each other.
