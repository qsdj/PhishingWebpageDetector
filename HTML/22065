       Nebraska Plastics, Inc. ("Nebraska Plastics") warrants all PVC products it manufactures to be free from defective raw materials and manufacturing defects for the consumer purchaser's choice of a) 50 years
       <strong>
        or

       b) limited lifetime.  If no selection is made, the Limited Lifetime Warranty shall apply.  As a result, the warranted products will not peel, flake, rust, blister or corrode.  Furthermore, Nebraska Plastics warrants that its PVC products will not require the painting and traditional maintenance normally associated with similar products manufactured from raw materials other than PVC, nor will the PVC products manufactured by Nebraska Plastics exhibit abnormal weathering, discoloration and brittleness or be damaged by insects.

        Is the warranty transferable?

       <br />

       <br />

       <b>
        How will Nebraska Plastics respond to valid warranty claims?

       </b>
       <br />
       <br />

Nebraska Plastics also reserves the right to refund the amount paid by the original purchaser for the warranted products.
       <br />
       <br />
       Nebraska Plastics retains the right to discontinue or modify any of its products, including the color, without notice to its customers.  Nebraska Plastics shall not be liable in the event the replacement material varies in color or gloss in comparison to the original product as a result of normal weathering. If Nebraska Plastics replaces any material under this warranty, it may substitute products designated by Nebraska Plastics to be of comparable quality or price range in the event the product initially installed has been discontinued or modified.
       <br />
       <br />
       All disputes shall be governed by Nebraska law.
