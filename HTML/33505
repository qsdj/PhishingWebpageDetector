          <p>
           Alan is one of a very lucky few who had the opportunity to grow
up in the pristine area of Bend and Central Oregon.  He took
advantage of the area at every turn to be out and about exploring,
adventuring and simply engulfing himself in the glorious
wilderness.
          </p>
          <p>
           Energetic leader with extensive experience in the high-tech and
outdoor sports industry.  Innovative, creative and personable
Alan was on the retail floor for fifteen years managing a NW company athletics, 
ski shops and electronic divisions. He was living his unending passion for sport and tech.  
Alan contributed to numerous Sales Advisory Committees throughout his career to help 
forge sales methodologies.  
He was a major contributor in helping several technology companies go IPO successfully.
          </p>
          <p>
           Alan participated in new, forming companies as he had the luck of the draw when Paul Allen 
bought the Blazers during his tenure and was in favor of utilizing the business team as a 
nucleus in which to springboard ideas and possibilities.  This would often include 
interaction with many of Paul’s satellite technology companies in the effort of building businesses 
that would appeal to and serve the public.

          </p>
          <p>
           Mary Meirow comes to AppWEAR with over 35 years of corporate financial expertise. 
Starting as an Accounts Payable clerk for a small construction company in Tualatin,
Oregon, she found her passion for numbers and dove in with a newly found zest.  After
working her way up to Corporate Controller, she realized her desire to start her own
construction company in Santa Rosa, California.
          </p>
          <p>
           Five years after, she was given a huge and exciting opportunity in the newly founded
and quickly growing web-based technology industry.  This was a chance that she
seized without hesitation!  During this time, she worked for several different
companies in Silicon Valley.  She worked at all levels including not only the financial
department of the businesses but also the in the IT and networking divisions.  She was
instrumental in the process of taking several companies public.  Mary has since
returned to the Portland-Metro area for quality of life and where her family lives. 
She currently works for a mid-size construction company as the Corporate Secretary
and CFO.
