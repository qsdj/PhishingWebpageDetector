     Here lies what we could salvage from the ashes of GeoCities.
     <br />
     <br />
     Yahoo! has done an amazing thing by keeping GeoCities alive for as long as they did, 
                but we feel that it is a waste to leave the Internet with a hole of this magnitude. 
                At a minimum, Yahoo! could have simply left GeoCities as a monument to the early days.
     <br />
     Maybe close it off from editing and simply make it static after getting rid of the spam pages once and for all.
     <br />
     Behind this minimalistic page stretches a wealth of Internet history. 
                If any of it was yours and we have successfully recovered it, then we hope it makes you happy to see it restored.
    </p>
    <p>
     We've rebuilt the walls to the Cities and the streets where a large part of the early settlers of the World Wide Web
                used to live in. You can still find them where they were before, but not all of the houses have been rebuilt yet.
     <br />
     <br />
     As time passes, we will try to recover more and more of what was lost, at least as much as is technically possible.
     <br />
     <br />
     If you have a website that links to old GeoCities content, and we've managed to restore 
                that content, we would like to ask you to change the links from
     <span class="highlight">
      G
     </span>
     eocities.com to
     <span class="highlight">
      R
     </span>
     eocities.com. 
               It's just a one letter change and it will help the Internet to hang together that much better.
     <br />
     <br />
     To fix links pointing to old GeoCities pages, we provide you with a small
     <a href="/static/js/reocities.user.js">
      Firefox Greasemonkey script
     </a>
     . That's not as good
                as having the links fixed on the pages themselves, but until people get around to that, it's a good thing to have. It saves you
                from getting error messages or landing in places that you didn't intend.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br />
     See the FAQ for most of your questions, one of them is so persistent I'll answer it here:
     <br />
     <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
     Why do it ? Why not let it go away, it was all junk anyway.
    </h4>
    <p>
     <br />
     In the millions of pages that we've archived, there are plenty of treasures. To make the point I'll link to one
                page of a person that died way too young and whose lasting contribution to the internet and all our future lives
                would have been lost without saving it somehow. *That* is why we did this.
     <br />
     <br />
     Not all of the pages here, or the story behind them are as moving
                as this one, but all of them together represent a wealth whose value will only become more 
                apparent over time, and which we hope will remain with us forever in some way.
     <br />
     <br />

     I hope that answer the 'why?' of it conclusively.

     Unfortunately, we currently cannot offer you a way to update, delete, or add pages. We don't know who the 
                original uploaders were (we are working on a verification method) and  have no access to the account credentials.
                We are still in the process of cleaning up pages to restore them to their former glory. Given the amount of data, we expect that 
                this process will take a while. In the mean time, feel free to explore. You probably know your way better around here than we do, 
                but if you need some guidance, have a look at the
     <a href="/neighborhoods/">
      neighborhoods listing

     .
