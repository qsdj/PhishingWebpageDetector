     </p>
     <p>
      Our Full-Day Preschool program offers a preschool class schedule and provides care from the hours of 6:30am to 6pm. In order for the 
			children to get the most of the program and to provide a daily routine, we ask that the children be at the center by 9:00am.  
			Parents may choose 2-5 days per week that the child is enrolled.  The children are provided with a morning snack, a 
			nutritious lunch, and an afternoon snack.

       Summer Program

      Our summer program is carefully planned by our staff to provide preschool and school-aged children with an exciting,

       ABC's Creative Curriculum for Toddlers
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      <u>
       Caring for the Little Ones
      </u>
      <br />
      Caring for the little ones under three is an awesome responsibility.  We know from research that more growth and development takes 
			place during the first three years of life than at any other time.  Those of us who work with children 
			during this critical period of life are helping to build a foundation and future for these children and their families.
     </p>
     <p>
      At ABC Childcare and Preschool, our caregivers understand that young children have special needs, a 
			unique learning style, and boundless energy.  So as you might imagine, a classroom for toddlers is a 
			very special place.  Our toddler classrooms are unique, exciting, and interesting; active learning 
			happens from the minute the first child walks though the door.  Our toddler rooms will look, sound, and feel 
			very different from classrooms designed to meet the needs of older children.  In a classroom for 
			toddlers learning is characterized by noise, activity, and a certain amount of mess.  Children will be moving about freely, 
			talking, singing, and laughing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <u>
       ABC's Philosophy is Business of Play
      </u>
      <br />
      Our curriculum and environment is child-centered. Our environment is organized and arranged to promote 
			free choice and active learning.  Children feel successful because there is a time and 
			opportunity for understanding their feelings as they master various skills.  ABC is proud to be adopting 
			the NAEYC (National Association of Education of Young Children) guidelines and beliefs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each toddler has his/her own pattern and speed of learning.  Our caregivers watch for signs of growth 
			and give toddlers respect, guidance, and encouragement to carry on and grow each day.  Through our trust 
			and support, we make it easier to learn new skills.
     </p>
     <p>
      <u>
       Understanding The Curriculum
      </u>
     </p>
     <p>
      As a teacher of young children, it is important to help them reach their full potential; in doing that we 
			must provide many interesting things for them to touch, taste, hear, smell, and see.  A typical day for 
			your young child at ABC consists of painting, playing house, building with blocks, working with puzzles, 
			looking at colorful picture books, dancing, pretending and much, much more!
     </p>
     <p>
      The major goal for our toddler curriculum is to excite our children about learning by exposing them to new 
			things to explore and discover.  It is not essential at this age to teach children to recite the 
			alphabet or count to ten.  It is far more important to excite toddlers about learning by giving them 
			opportunities to make discoveries on their own about themselves and the world around them.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each caregiver puts together a weekly lesson plan filled with daily activities.  Our fall curriculum and 
			lesson plans are extensively structured.
     </p>

      In addition to all these daily activities, we also offer sensory experiences, self help skills, 
			multicultural activities, and group time.  Outdoor play is built into the daily schedule year round 
			(weather permitting).  Outdoor play is important and valuable!  You will receive a copy of our 
			written curriculum at the time of enrollment.

       Summer Fun Program
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      During the summer months, June-August, our curriculum is much more relaxed.  Although 
			caregivers continue to prepare lesson plans and activities for the children, they are less structured 
			and have more of an emphasis on having fun and enjoying the summer.  The lesson plans are based on the fun 
			and exciting themes.
