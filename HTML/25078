           </p>
           <p>
            4.2. Every one of your referrals, as users, must have a unique email address.
           </p>
           <p>
            4.3. You must not send unsolicited email or force anyone in any other way into becoming your referral. You also cannot use any service that attempts to sell you referrals. We will verify such incidents and they will result in account termination.
           </p>
           <p>
            4.4. Rented referrals have a return policy. If, within 14 days one of your rented referrals does not click any advertisement, you will automatically get your referral exchanged with no additional charge and for unlimited times. This exchange policy is only for rented referrals and they will only be replaced when new ones are available. Rented referrals are distributed based on an activity rule but we cannot predict or assure how they will behave afterwards. Letting a referral expire will have a small fee ranging from $0.02 to $0.05 depending on your current membership.
           </p>
           <p>
            4.5. You can only rent referrals when they are available and within the limits of your current membership. Having more referrals than the allowed amount will result in the deactivation of the earnings from all referrals.
           </p>
           <p>
            4.6. The clicks you earn from referrals are directly related to the clicks you make. If you click at least 4 advertisements being a Standard member or you click at least 8 advertisements being a Upgraded member, you'll receive all clicks made from your referrals. If you click below that, the maximum you will receive is only the amount of clicks you've made multiplied by the number of referrals you have. The referral clicks will be calculated based on the clicks you made on the previous day. These calculations are based on the server time which can be seen in the (View Ads) page.
           </p>
           <p>
            4.7. A referral will never be able to modify the member who referred him/her.
           </p>
           <p>
            4.8. The clicks made by your referrals will be credited to your account instantly. However, depending on the server load, they can be credited within 24 hours.
           </p>
           <p>
            4.9. The amount of referrals is limited based on the referrer's membership. The users can see the limit in the referrals listing page.
