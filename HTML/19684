           As one door closed, another opened some other possibilities. A number of schools, particularly in the Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League (WPIAL), have their games carried on the Internet, often with students doing play-by-play duties and gaining experience.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hollidaysburg Area is one such school.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Golden Tiger Football Association paid for the equipment to enable the student broadcasts.
          </p>
          <p>
           "Our student-delivered broadcasts are going quite well," Kevin Sensenig, GTFA president, said. "They draw an audience of around 500 watchers (as both audio and video are streamed). It is a nice opportunity for students interested in a journalism, broadcast or sports broadcasting career."
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Hollidaysburg students Sam Sky
           </strong>
           and Bronson Woodring have been handling the Tiger broadcasts.
          </p>
          <p>
           "I am loving the opportunity to broadcast games online," Sky, a senior, said. "I love the thrill of being live, but I also love the experience of analyzing the game and what I see to the viewers. Having the opportunity to show my personality is great for me as a high school student and hopefully future broadcasting student."

            Condolences to the family of Laura Scheinberg
           </strong>
           who passed away on Monday, Sept. 14, 2015, in Pittsburgh. Laura is survived by her sons Benjamin and Nathan.
          </p>
          <p>
           A celebration of Laura's life will be held at 2 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 19, 2015, at The Good Funeral Home Inc., Alto-Reste Park Cemetery.
          </p>
          <p>
           Laura graduated from Penn State University in 1985 with a B.A. in communications and retired from the Travelers Insurance Co. in 2011 as a bodily injury/liability claims adjuster. She spent countless hours volunteering within the Penn State Alumni Association and the Jewish and Altoona communities, and she continued to volunteer at the Van Zandt VA Medical Center in Altoona, logging in more than 300 hours before her health declined.
          </p>
          <p>
           Laura was a beautiful, loving and caring woman who continued to spread her love to everyone who met her, even as her cancer progressed.

            Congratulations to Neil Port.
           </strong>
           From the Altoona Mirror, "A local artistic production company is going to try to pack a decade of memories and music into one night as it celebrates a milestone. P&amp;J Productions and the Altoona Mirror will present "A Night of Music and Memories'' at the Mishler Theatre in Altoona on Sept. 10, 2005. P&amp;J, which stands for the partnership of area businessman Neil Port and composer Will Jones, this year celebrates 10 years of bringing quality shows to Blair County audiences.Port, who is also a musician, met Jones in 2005 when both were auditioning for "The Music Man.'' Together they formed their production company, starting with performances of shows Jones wrote such as "Sherwood: The Musical Adventures of Robin Hood'' and "A Christmas Caroled,'' Port said."

           "We've had hundreds of performances at the Mishler Theatre and we've had very positive feedback from literally tens of thousands of people over the years from the theatergoers who come to see the shows, many who return year after year,'' he said. "We also get great feedback from the actors in the shows. These kids, the people who are in the shows, this is something they'll remember for the rest of their lives.''

           "For years when my mother, Lynn, said her evening prayers, she would include a prayer for the half-sister she never knew: If my sister is living, I pray that she is well. If my sister is not living, I pray that people remember her fondly.
          </p>
          <p>
           When I was a teenager, my mother shared a complicated part of her family’s story. She explained that my grandfather, Georg Auerbach, who had died when I was 6, had been married when he lived in Europe — and had a daughter with his first wife. Mom didn’t know anything else — not her half-sister’s name or where she lived. But she sometimes imagined meeting her."

            Condolences to the family of Charlotte Lee Morris.
           </strong>
           Charlotte, 90, died Monday, April 20, 2015, at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Md. She was a longtime resident of Altoona and a vibrant member of the Altoona community.
          </p>
          <p>
           Charlotte's involvement with the community was legendary. She served on many boards that greatly contributed to the Altoona community, working in particular to improve the lives of children and adults. She served as president and vice president of the Blair County Civic Music Association and as chair of its artist and talent selection committee for many decades, which brought in nationally and internationally known performing artists to the Blair County area. She worked with New York booking agencies, including Columbia Artists and the William Morris Agency, to bring in five concerts every year at affordable prices, featuring artists such as Harry Belafonte, Beverly Sills, Marcel Marceau, Michael Feinstein and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Subsequently, she helped to establish the Blair County Civic Music Foundation Scholarship, which awards scholarships to high school students who are interested in studying or training in the performing arts.

           Hanukkah, also known as the Festival of Lights, often falls in December. This year is no exception with the eight-day holiday beginning at sunset Tuesday. December is also a time when malls are decked out with greenry and lights for Christmas, and kids are making out wish lists for Santa.
          </p>
          <p>
           For families where both parents are Jewish, the glitter and hype of the Christmas season, can be explained to their children as a Christian celebration, while Jews celebrate Hanukkah. In interfaith families, where one parent is Jewish and the other adheres to Christianity or another faith tradition, the answer may not be as easy.

           HIGH SCHOOL PUSH RECORD
            HOLLIDAYSBURG 2013
          </p>
          <p>
                       In 2004, Curtis  Rupp established the Hollidaysburg High School  boy’s push up record with an impressive 90 push ups. The testing is part of the FITNESSGRAM program which was the successor to the Presidential Fitness Testing.
           <br />
                       In 2013, nine years later, that record was finally broken.
           <strong>
            GINGER GLASS
           </strong>
           established a new High School Push up record with 91 monitored push ups. The testing utilized the FitnessGram program with two physical education teachers on site. Michael Moore, the senior phys. Ed. teacher, explained that a CD counts and paces each push up. The program ended at an 85 count which required the staff to continue the count.
           <br />
                       The previous record for girls was also established by
           <strong>
            GINGER GLASS
           </strong>
            in 2010.  She has now broken both the
           <strong>
            BOY
           </strong>
           and
           <strong>
            girl
           </strong>
           push up record. Moore noted that a minimum of 12 push ups are required to score 100% in class. “Glass said she would beat the boy’s record, and she did it.”
           <br />
           The record board displayed outside the Gym includes
           <strong>
            GINGER’S  
           </strong>
           fall semester pull up  record established in 2011, an impressive 14 pull ups. Remarkably she beat her own record in the Spring semester
           <br />
           with 20 pull ups. YOU GO GIRL!

           Celebrate Diversity was established in 1993 to introduce diversity awareness programs into local junior highs to erase intolerance and raise awareness about attitudes of prejudice.  There is an annual teacher training and four student education days, including a visit to the United States National Holocaust Museum in Washington, D. C.  Approximately 300 seventh and eight graders each year participate.  Federation is a co-sponsor and one of the founders of the program.  The Federation funds the transportation costs for the annual trip to the Holocaust Museum.  Over the years Celebrate Diversity has become a non-profit 501c3 and has established itself as a self-maintaining corporation with it’s own board of directors.

            Congratulations to Rabbi Audrey Korotkin
           </strong>
           , a featured speaker at  "Law Day 2013"on May 4, 2013. She provided the following:
           <br />
           <br />
           "The theme for the day was "Realizing the Dream, Equality for All." I spoke,
            first, of the commonality of American and Jewish law and their focus on
            equality, opportunity, and dignity, and of how our founders, even though
            they deliberately did not want a theocracy, clearly were influenced by
            Jewish ethical commandments. This was particularly noteworthy for the
            inscription on the Liberty Bell from Leviticus 25:10, "Proclaim Liberty
            throughout the land, unto all the inhabitants thereof," which just happened
            to be from the scriptural portion we read that night.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also spoke of my own personal journey, growing up with the idea that I
              could become anything as long as I wanted it and worked for it. I spoke of
            both taking advantage of opportunities offered, and of creating
              opportunities, of my past successful and non-traditional careers breaking
              glass ceilings as a broadcast journalist and as a sports marketing
              executive. And I spoke about the commitments we make to one another in small
              congregations and small communities, and the way we take care of one another
           <br />
           instinctively."

           UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. - Penn State junior Scott Rosenthal (Clearfield, Pa.) has been honored as Big Ten Gymnast of the Week, the conference office announced on Monday. He was recognized with the award for the second time in his career for his record-setting performance in the No. 6 Nittany Lions' convincing victory over No. 14 Army on Saturday.
           <br />
           Rosenthal helped Penn State post the nation's highest team total in the season's first week (349.800), capturing the still rings title in milestone fashion. The 2011 All-American shattered the Nittany Lion  record and tied the NCAA FIG-scoring era rings mark, recording a 16.300.

          <p>
           As a sophomore in 2011, the local central Pennsylvania product established himself as one of the nation's top still rings performers. Rosenthal won titles in the event in nine of 10 regular season meets and finished second at the Big Ten Championships, earning Second Team All-Big Ten honors. At the National Collegiate Championships qualifier, he helped Penn State set a program record as a team in the still rings (62.300), placing second with a score of 15.850.

            Condolences to the family of Ruth Covitch
           </strong>
           who passed peacefully on Friday, September 9, 2011, at Rebekah Manor, surrounded by family.
          </p>
          <p>
           As co-owner of J. Covitch &amp; Son clothing store, Ruth created the Ladies Custom Corner and produced fashion shows for the Ebensburg community. She also served as president of the Ebensburg Woman's Club and Cambria County Woman's Club, board member of Children &amp; Youth Services and docent at the Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art and the Cambria County Historical Society.
          </p>
          <p>
           As a child, Ruth danced under local ballet legend Ruth Barnes and, later, in the thespian club at Penn State, where she earned a degree in social work and met her husband of 68 years - on a blind date. Her poise and kind humor, as well as her love of gardening, jelly making, gourmet cooking, world traveling and, of course, dancing, live on in the many people she touched.

           In Panim el Panim seminars and programs, teens learn from and become friends with a broad network of Jewish teens from around the country. Together they receive advocacy training, participate in service learning and have the opportunity to lobby their elected officials on Capitol Hill, putting what they have learned into action. All Panim el Panim seminars include interactive sessions in which students relate Jewish texts and values to the world around them.
          </p>
          <p>

           Scott  of Clearfield,  grew up watching the national powerhouse Nittany Lions and dreamed of joining them one day. Since his high school did not have a team, he trained with Gemini Gymnastics in Altoona. Even after success with Gemini, including his career highlight so far of winning a regional title in 2009, not one college recruited him.

           , who passed away peacefully Friday at his home. He was born in Wilmington, Del., the eldest child of the late Joseph Cohen and Beatrice (Bell) Cohen. He was a member of Agudath Achim Congregation of Altoona.

          <p>
           Growing up in Wilmington, Steve was a natural athlete, talented at every sport he tried, but his true passion was baseball. Steve was also a very gifted debater and writer, which led him to study political science at the University of Delaware. While there, Steve played soccer, participated on the debate team and was very active with his fraternity. His next step after college was law school, but he decided halfway through that he would enlist in the United States Army and served during the Vietnam War.

           "On Sunday November 7th, 2010 I ran the New York City Marathon. It was a beautiful day.  This was my 5th New York City Marathon and 30th overall. The experience was exhilirating and the 26.2 mile race was extra special because of the Achilles Athletes I met and ran with throughout the 6 hour 13 minute jaunt through the 5 boroughs of New York City. Years ago, my marathon times were under 4 hours but I guess I no longer the spring chicken I used to be and I decided to really enjoy the crowds and experience this year and not worry about how fast I was going.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thanks for your support of Achilles and my running efforts. I am now training for the Dec. 5th Nittany Valley Half Marathon in State College which is on Sunday Dec. 5th. It will be my 4th year in a row running this challenging and hilly course. But nothing can compare to the New York City Marathon course and experience.  My only regret is that I did not see on the course also running or get to meet Jared from Subway,  the Chilean Miner, Al Roker, Bobby Flay, Amani Toomer, Robin Quivers or any of the other famous people who ran the Marathon. Happy Running or whatever makes you happy."

           The Coal Country Hangout Youth Center kicked off its project Friday to renovate the 85-year-old B’Nai Israel Synagogue to provide offices for United Way agencies and storage space for the borough and Susquehanna Historical Society.
          </p>
          <p>
           The project also includes research into the history of the synagogue and the Jewish families that immigrated to the area after World War I by 15 junior and senior class students at Northern Cambria High School. The research project is a continuation of the school’s “Cambria Re-coal-lection” series that enables the students to learn about local history in addition to the regular social studies curriculum.
          </p>
          <p>
           The synagogue was built in 1925 and has been vacant since 1968, when it was closed because only one Jewish family remained in the area.

           Nowadays, my very favorite people to cook with are my children George, 7 and June, 4. We often make a simple recipe like a fruit salad or batch of cookies together in the late afternoon. In the kitchen, we reconnect after they have been at school and I have been at work. We make cakes together for each other's birthdays and experiment with new recipes based on our favorite spices and flavors.
          </p>
          <p>
           For George, who has autism, cooking has been an important way for him to develop his fine and gross motor skills, gain essential sensory input, and work on language and literacy. Cooking has also helped him to develop a longer attention span and to engage in sharing joint attention with me.
          </p>
          <p>
           But more importantly, cooking is just fun! And so is eating good food! Whether you are a parent, teacher, grandparent or friend of a child, I hope that you will enjoy my new book. Kitchen Classroom is a unique cookbook that features 32 visual recipes, broken down into small steps written in words and depicted in photographs of George and June hard at work! Next month, I'll be launching my "Kitchen Classroom 4 Kids" website, featuring weekly recipes &amp; tips.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the meantime, stay cool and happy cooking!
           <br />

           was recently interviewed about the history of the It was 1968 when all but one Jewish family had left the town of Barnesboro. The Roots were the only Jewish family left, so the synagogue, which was built in 1925, closed its doors forever.But it is to occupied again. The structure is to be restored and used by the United Way and other social services.
          </p>
          <p>
           When it closed 42 years ago, each of the four Root children was given a piece of the synagogue's stained glass, which they display proudly in their homes. One of them, Paula Pimentel, who now lives in Altoona, cherishes the stained glass, a reminder of the synagogue.

            Agudath Achim Sisterhood
           </strong>
           held a "High Tea" to prepare shalach manot packages for Israeli soldiers. Chanale Stein led an enlightening discussion about Esther and her heroism, and  games were played about the story of Purim.
          </p>
          <p>
           Mishloach manot (pronounced "mish-LOH-ach mah-NOTE,", literally, "sending of portions"; also spelled mishloach manos and sometimes shortened to shalach manos), and also called a Purim basket, are gifts of food or drink that are sent to friends, relatives, neighbors, teachers, business associates, and any other acquaintances on Purim day. The mitzvah of giving mishloach manot derives from the Book of Esther. It is meant to ensure that everyone has enough food for the Purim feast held later in the day, and to increase love and friendship among Jews as a counter to Haman's assertion that the Jewish people are characterized by strife and disunity.

           Morris was a 1936 graduate of Altoona High School.

He served in the U.S. Army, landing on Utah Beach on D-Day Plus 2, and he served in France until he was relieved of duty because of battle fatigue and a flareup of allergies. On his return from the military, Morris and his wife, Bess, started the Morris Levine Family Shoe Store. They served the area faithfully for 52 years and sold their business in 1988 upon their retirement. Morris and Bess were dedicated to and active participants in the life of the Tyrone community.

            On behalf of the Temple Adult Ed Committee, I want to express appreciation for your participation. The turn-out was highly respectable, thanks to you. 
              At a minimum, those who were present learned something that many people seem to be unaware of: Someone else's beliefs may seem very odd to you--and your beliefs may seem odd to others. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE "OTHER" IS BAD AND WORTHY OF YOUR ANGER AND EVEN HATRED. We can certainly appreciate that the "other" may be a lovely person and that we and they can co-exist, like each other, and even become good friends. 
              Ms. Anwar LOVED the folks she met! She was impressed with us on several levels, I am happy to report.

            Edward M. (Eddy) Petsonk died Friday, May 22, 2009, in Somerset, NJ, at the age of 93.  The son of Polish Jewish immigrants, he grew up in New York City, and in 1937 received a degree in electrical engineering from the City College of New York.  In 1941 Mr. Petsonk came to Altoona, where he met Julia Leopold of Hollidaysburg.  They wed the next year and were married for 57 years until Julia passed away in 2000.  During the Second World War, Ed served his country as an aeronautical engineer.  After the War, he entered the electrical contracting business in Hillside, New Jersey, and shortly thereafter established Electrical Contractors Associates and Blair Electric Service Company in Altoona.  Subsequently those companies provided electrical construction services for many industrial facilities, schools and hospitals in the central Pennsylvania region.  
           </p>
           <p>
            Ed was a charming, dynamic man who relished life and was devoted to his family and community.   He cared greatly about youth, supporting the Boy Scouts as a scoutmaster and member of the Scout Council.  He supported programs for disadvantaged young people by establishing college scholarships and providing leadership for Tomorrow’s Citizens, a program that offered gainful employment for troubled youth, many of whom went on to become community leaders. 
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Petsonk was very active in Altoona’s Jewish community and was a dedicated supporter of Israel.  Over the years he served as president of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, Temple Beth Israel, the Jewish Memorial Center, and chaired the Israel Bond drive on several occasions.  With his wife, he initiated a Holocaust Education program in Altoona schools, a program that continues today. 
           </p>
           <p>
            A lifelong supporter of athletics, he helped promote tennis and other racquet sports in Altoona.  He continued to enjoy playing tennis until the age of 91.  Ed also was an avid skier, and was the principal developer of the Blue Knob Ski Resort in 1963. 
           </p>
           <p>
            Ed loved music, and participated in and led singing programs after he moved to West Virginia in 1995, and later in New Jersey, where he resided for the last year of his life.  
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Petsonk is survived by his older brother George Shire, of Millersville, PA; four children:  Judy, journalist and author of two non-fiction books; Lee, physician and researcher for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; Andy, environmental consultant in Sweden; and Carol Annette, international environmental lawyer; and seven grandchildren.  
           </p>
           <p>
            He will be deeply missed. 
           </p>
           <p>
            Services will be held on Tuesday, May 26, at Temple Beth Israel in Altoona, Pennsylvania, commencing at 11:00 a.m., followed by interment at the Mt. Sinai Cemetery. Rabbi David Feder of Tree of Life Congregation, Morgantown, WV, will officiate.   Visitation with family members prior to the service will begin at 10:00 a.m. at Temple Beth Israel.  Members of the community will also be welcomed at the home of Phil and Roz Sky from 7:00-9:00 p.m. Tuesday evening.  Those wishing to make donations in Ed’s memory are encouraged to give to the charity of their choice.

            Thanks to Marilyn Muhlfelder and Carolyn Wallen for coordinating our 4th annual Love Feast held on Dec. 27, 2008 at Simpson Church. Special thanks to Paula and Dave Binus for leading our cooking brigade and to all our adults and children who contributed money, desserts and their time for this mitzvah. We served about 125 meals, sent another 50 home and we gave all leftovers to St. Vincent De Paul soup kitchen. We are already signed up for Dec. 26, 2009.

            Our Jewish community was well represented at the Interfaith Signs of Justice program on Jan. 18. Phil Devorris was a featured speaker and Hazzan Horwitz led an interfaith children’s choir in singing Shalom B’Olam. Featured in the choir were Howie Keenan, soloist, and Felicia Devorris, Abigail Simon, Samantha Bilofsky and Jacob and Noah Scheinberg. The program began with Elliott Bilofsky sounding the Shofar as a call to social justice.

            Our local SAVE Darfur Chapter recently sent over $16,000 to Jewish World Watch to benefit their backpacks for kids and solar cooker projects in the refugee camps in Chad for the Sudanese genocide survivors. Total donations from our group now exceed $17,000. Our local teens and adults have shown again that we can really make a difference.
