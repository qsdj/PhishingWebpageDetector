      </li>
      <li>
       Upon departure, the child is to be escorted from the center with the parents or authorized adult listed on 
				the release form and signed out on the log in the front window. This adult must notify the teacher before 
				leaving the center.  For safety's sake, children may not run to the car alone.  You must call to 
				authorize another person picking up your child.
      </li>
      <li>
       Telephones are in the classrooms and in the office for emergencies.

        Discipline Policy
       </b>
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      Discipline with love, respect and consistency is used at A.B.C.. It promotes self-esteem and self control.  
			The following techniques are means of discipline used for the purpose of modeling and changing behavior.
     </p>
     <br />
     <ol>
      <li>
       Setting clear, consistent and age appropriate limits in the classroom.
      </li>
      <li>
       Encouraging children to take responsibility for their own actions through the use of logical consequences.  
				For example: "When you poured water on the floor, it got wet.  Please use a paper towel and clean it up."
      </li>
      <li>
       Using a clear, calm, and low voice with the children to represent the appropriate voice level to be used.  
				This same technique is used to modify language and behavior.
      </li>
      <li>
       Redirecting the child to more appropriate activities.
      </li>
      <li>
       Helping children to resolve conflict through communication. Teaching them how to "use their words", 
				to express their feelings. This will enable them to resolve conflict on their own.
      </li>
      <li>
       Using "time-out" very sparingly when the child has repeatedly challenged authority or intentionally injured another child.
      </li>
      <li>
       If a child has repeatedly challenged authority, the child may be asked to sit with their head down for rest 
				in "time out" or maybe asked to leave the center for a day.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Physical punishment is
      <u>
       never
      </u>
      used at our center. Our staff will not shout, humiliate, or subject your 
			child to verbal abuse.  This will not be tolerated in our center at any time from anyone. If your child is 
			consistently displaying inappropriate behavior, despite our efforts, we will communicate our concerns to you and 
			work with you to rectify the situation. In the event that the behavior continues, we may ask you to withdraw 
			your child from the center.  This policy is in place for the protection of all of our children.

        Illness Policy

     <p>
      If any child displays any of the following symptoms, it will then be required that the parent be called and the 
			child be picked up within
      <b>
       1 hour.
      </b>
      Once the symptoms or fever have subsided for a period of 24 
			hours, the child may then return to the center.  We reserve the right to request a written statement from 
			the child's doctor to insure the child's illness is no longer a threat to others.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       Fever of 100 degrees or above, under the arm.
      </li>
      <li>
       Diarrhea or vomiting two or more times in the same day.
      </li>
      <li>
       Difficult or rapid breathing.
      </li>
      <li>
       Yellowish skin or eyes.
      </li>
      <li>
       Pink eye.
      </li>
      <li>
       Skin rash that has not been identified in writing by the child's doctor.
      </li>
      <li>
       Evidence of head lice or any other parasitic infection.
      </li>
      <li>
       Sore throat or difficulty swallowing.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Children who develop these symptoms while in the center will be isolated in the office under the supervision of 
			an adult until the parent arrives to pick the child up.  Parents will receive written notice that their child has 
			been exposed to a communicable disease.  This notice will be posted on the door in the front hall.  
			As a courtesy to us, we ask that parents inform us as well if their child has contracted a communicable 
			disease.
     </p>
     <p>
      Should any type of medication need to be administered by our staff, the parent will need to fill out a medication 
			form, bring the medicine in the original container, make sure that it is age and weight appropriate for that 
			child, and that it is not expired.  If medicine is required on a month to month basis, you will then be 
			required to fill out a new form each month.
