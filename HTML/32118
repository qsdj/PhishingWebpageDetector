    Chapter #2 - Friends with the Net

  </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   <img width="270" vspace="0" hspace="10" height="370" border="0" align="RIGHT" alt="TENNIS INSTRUCTION" src="images/tennis-instruction.gif" />
   The
    first idea of High Percentage Tennis is that you must become friends 
   with the net.  It's better to hit the ball six feet too high 
   than one inch too low. 
  </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The Pros, the best tennis players in the world, make deep errors in a 
   2 to 1 ratio to net errors.  They go nuts when they miss into 
   the net.  If they hit one out, they don't particularly like it, 
   but they know that it only takes a very slight technical adjustment 
   of their stroke to bring the next shot into the court.  A netted 
   error takes a much more difficult, technical correction to bring the 
   next shot over the net.
  </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   I get tennis students all the time who will hit three, four, five 
   balls into the net and think nothing of it. Then when they hit one 
   out they moan about how terrible they are.  These people need an 
   attitude adjustment, a "goal" reversal. They should be 
   moaning at the netted balls and not worrying about the out balls.
  </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   When I practice I don't care about any shot I've missed within three 
   feet of the baseline.  I don't care if it's a groundstroke, a 
   volley, or smash, because I know that on match day it's normal and 
   natural to be a little tight.  If my muscles are 10% tight on 
   match day, the same shot that was three feet out on practice day will 
   be in the court.  Players who don't understand High Percentage 
   Tennis tend to hit the ball too low and too short on practice day, so 
   when match day rolls around and they are naturally 10% tight, their 
   shots end up in the net or falling shallow in the court.
  </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Nobody wants to make errors, but those players who understand High 
   Percentage Tennis understand that it's always better to hit out than 
   into the net.  Make friends with the net.  If you don't 
   beat the net, the net won't beat you. The net is the major obstacle 
   on the tennis court ... a much bigger obstacle than the lines. 
  </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The lines are a minor detail compared to the net.  If you hit 
   the net you lose the point 100% of the time.  If you clear the 
   net, even with a shot that's going out, there are many different ways 
   you can still win the point.  If you don't believe me, listen to 
   this: if you clear the net, your out shot might hit your opponent, 
   your opponent may hit the ball either by accident or because they 
   don't realize it's going out, and your shot may suddenly be blown in 
   by the wind.  In all of these cases you extend or win the point!
  </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   It's just like in baseball, there are many more ways to score from 
   third base than from second base.  In tennis there are many more 
   ways to succeed by clearing the net than by not. Sounds simple and 
   obvious, but most players underestimate the net in relation to the lines.

  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Your tennis "goals" in order of importance should be 
   firstly a deep shot, no matter what speed it's been hit (lob, medium 
   speed drive, or sizzling smash), if it's deep it will be effective. 
   Secondly, ...
