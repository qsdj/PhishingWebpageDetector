          Avoiding a Conviction at All Costs
         </h3>
         <p>
          If you are a college student that has been charged with a crime, or are the parent of a college student, it is essential that you
          <em>
           <strong>
            work to avoid a conviction at all costs
           </strong>
          </em>
          . Being found guilty of any crime means that you could potentially face heavy fines, jail time, community service, the loss of your license and a permanent criminal record. Even misdemeanor crimes like petty theft or vandalism leave you with a criminal record that could compromise your continuing education and will show up on background checks performed by potential employers.
          <em>
           Few things are as frustrating as graduating college and being unable to obtain employment due to a past criminal record.
          </em>
         </p>
         <p>
          The first step to fighting back against being accused of a crime is to consult with a
          <a href="http://www.FrankWalkerLaw.com">
           seasoned criminal defense lawyer in Pennsylvania

          Working With a Pittsburgh College Crime Defense Attorney
         </h3>
         <p>
          The college disciplinary hearing is separate from the criminal proceedings that have arisen out of the accusations against you. It is not uncommon for a college student that has been charged of a crime to be required to submit to a disciplinary hearing at the school while the criminal case is still pending. However, those who are currently involved in a criminal case have the right to remain silent and not say anything that could
