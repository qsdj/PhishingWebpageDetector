       Stop hiding behind the pristine dune excuse to stop the community oceanway from Bilinga to Tugun.
       <br />
       <br />
       The dunes along the planned Bilinga to Tugun Oceanway are called 'urbanised dunes'.  They are not pristine dunes as some would have you believe.
       <br />
       <br />
       At present there is concrete paths, slabs of concrete, concrete steps and paved areas, this has all been done by residents and developers on this dune area.
       <br />
       <br />
       An existing beachfront house had a relaxation approved to add a new covered deck pushing it very close to the dune area.
       <br />
       <br />
       Some of the dunes at the Tugun end have been completely flattened and turfed, all the dune grasses have been removed.
       <br />
       <br />
       Trees have been killed and cut down to improve views.  If you walk or ride on the present oceanway path from Bilinga you will see how green those dunes are.
       <br />
       <br />
       Photos were taken by a Dune Care representative of a resident in the dunes mowing the dune grass.  This has all been uncovered since the partial removal of illegal encroachments and the community has been able to access this area.
       <br />
       <br />
       If these dune protectors cared so much, they would be asking for the concrete and the remaining illegal encroachments to be removed.
       <br />
       <br />
       They would also be asking Gold Coast council to explain why a house extension was allowed to come so close to the dunes they want protected.
       <br />
       <br />
       The Bilinga to Tugun oceanway is to promote inclusion within our community for all.  Not completing it only promotes exclusion.

       If the current discussion about beachside thoroughfares in Currumbin, Tugun and Bilinga is about public access, Cr Chris Robbins, then your claim in the Sun (25 Jun)
       <a href="http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/gold-coast/petition-push-for-bilinga-to-tugun-oceanway-as-debate-rages/story-fnj94idh-1227434903437">

         read article here,
        </strong>
       </a>
       that the public access stretch between Tomewin Street Currumbin and Flat Rock was now "very firm and suitable for wheelchairs, bikes and prams" is not quite right.
       <br />
       <br />
       I can see why you would take the view as, sitting in a car looking down the stretch from Tomewin St, the first 30m of the track is firm and easily navigable.  But then it drops away beyond sight and one has to actually walk the track to the footbridge at Flat Rock Creek to see its true condition.  Aside from the three sand 'bunkers' stretching across the neck of Len Wort Park near Flat Rock Creek which are annoyances for all, you could claim that it is navigable for sure-footed walkers, those on bikes, and not too much of a problem for those pushing prams.
       <br />
       <br />
       But the rutted areas, erosion, slope and holes along the track make it totally unsuitable for wheelchairs, or those relying on 'wheelie walkers'.
       <br />
       <br />
       And since you raised it, a sealed path would overcome such obstacles plus complete the beachside path connection between Kropp Park Tugun and Pacific Parade Currumbin.  It would also allow for easier and safer use after sunset.
       <br />
       <br />
       However, on this I note your general claim that it has been left as a 'green corridor' because of opposition to a sealed path.
       <br />
       <br />
       Has there been community consultation undertaken around this or simply representation from one or two land owners there who do not want a path?
       <br />
       <br />
       And if so, is it just me or does this sound familiar to some of the discussion around the Tugun to Bilinga Oceanway?
       <br />
       <br />
       So if accessibility is the primary issue, I invite Cr Robbins to revist both tracks - the current dirt track along the Tugun to Bilinga beachfront and the Flat Rock to Tomewin St Currumbin track - for an accessibility update.

       Gold Coast City Councillor Chris Robbins' intention to provide us with a thin white painted line along Golden Four Drive at Bilinga to presumably protect us from tons of steel hurtling towards us at speed is of a bygone era.
       <br />
       <br />
       And apart from lack of safety it is dull and noisy.  Let her show us her 'metal' by providing us with a safe passage, and a scenic one at that.  The land seaward of the properties is not private land, it is our land - it is our unformed Pacific Parade.  Let it be used for its intended purpose.  A grassed path is now well established; benefit yourself with a quiet, clean ocean walk.

       Ah, Yes! So much better to keep an eye on the waves than those damn tons of steel roaring up from behind in the form of cars and buses let alone those sneaky opening doors of vehicles. All Councillor Robbins is providing for protection is a thin white line, and not even a sedative or an ear-plug to reduce the roar of traffic. Surely the calmness of the wide blue line of the ocean and the sound of waves is our preference.

       I love my beach walks and the concept of the Oceanway. It is much safer and healthier than detouring along Golden Four Drive. The Currumbin to Tugun leg is very popular which was also a struggle to get approval before finally overturned. In my view rationality will eventually prevail and a lovely beachside walk will come about.

       Gold Coast City Councillor Chris Robbins has told us that noisy and dangerous Golden Four Drive is her preferred option for us - her constituents - to ride and walk between Tugun and Bilinga rather than upon the scenic and safe unformed road reserve seaward of the properties along Golden Four Drive.
       <br />
       This, she says, is because that was the result of her second consultation.  Cr Robbins adds that her second consultation only gave us the choice of Golden Four Drive because that was the outcome of her first consultation.
       <br />
       Hence, if her first consultation was flawed then so are the findings of her second.  Her first was flawed.
       <br />
       First, no one had the opportunity of walking the road reserve seaward of the properties in Golden Four Drive, for these owners had fenced us out.
       <br />
       Second, Cr Robbins targeted that group of residents by sending each a letter inviting them to vote.
       <br />
       Third, residents were not told that if they voted for Golden Four Drive, they would lose their parking.  When the process of consulting targets a select group, the consultation is a farce.
       <br />
       Despite this, 34 per cent of that target group wanted the bike/walkway seaward of their properties, and 69 per cent of those who did not live on Golden Four Drive wanted to walk and ride seaward of those properties.

       <br />
       Following a deeply flawed survey involving principally oceanfront residents reluctant to share the beach front road reserve, the construction was halted and the funding returned to the Queensland Government.
       <br />
       <br />
       We will continue the struggle to right this injustice levelled at Southern Gold Coasters who want no more than the other residents of the Gold Coast who enjoy the Oceanway at our many other beautiful beachfront suburbs.

       At present the dunal area from Tooloona St TUGUN to the Bilinga Surf Club is
selfishly controlled by a number of residents [not all] that live along this
particular area and for some reason consider that they, and no one else
should have access to the area.
       <br />
       Unfortunately our misinformed local Councillor also appears to exhibit a
denial attitude against the local area residents as well as a great number
of Gold Coasters and visitors from Australia and overseas that the Oceanway
is not wanted .How much further from the truth can this be and what is
required to get the majority of peoples wishes through to Council that the
Oceanway is not a bucket list wish but a very important project that is
required for the present and future residents of this area.
       <br />
       The most recent Resident information night at Tugun Bowls club to advise
locals of the proposed upgrade of Golden Four Drive to include wider bicycle
lanes, changes to vehicle parking and traffic was met with great opposition
and requests were made to bring the Oceanway access back to fruition.
Unfortunately our Councillor, once again refused to take notice or enter
into any discussion as the information night was to deal with Golden Four
Drive and no other issues.
       <br />
       The bicycle lane alteration to Golden Four Drive is only relevant to the
riders of racing type bicycles who are looking for a better and wider lane
to utilize and whilst this is commendable it does not in anyway, shape or
form give the majority of people any benefit what so ever. The current media
hysteria re the so called bad attitude culture between cyclists and
motorists only adds to the unbalanced reaction from the Council and road
authorities. The recent comments from the Council and Councillor that the
cost of the proposed Golden Four Drive upgrade would blow out because some
one forgot about the under ground Gas line that, incidentally was up graded
only a few years back is also beyond belief and makes the initial selection
of this direction of expenditure completely farcical.
       <br />
       Back to the dunal area discussion,

the few people that are against the Oceanway are the very people who have
desecrated the area by bringing in exotic plants, making lawned areas of the
dunes, building unapproved structures, parking boats and trailers on the
dunes and after fencing this public area off have the audacity to hinder and
deny fellow residents use of the area as it may effect their privacy!!
Heaven help us when we have this mentality of people as neighbours and in
public office.
       <br />
       The State Government has declared the area as public space and the Gold
Coast City Council as the nominees to monitor this space and yet the Council
still makes mockery of the debate by the results of questionable local
surveys and consultations that they use as an argument.
       <br />
       All open meetings with residents, local and others as well as well informed
inputs from knowledgeable persons all agree the Oceanway can only be a major
benefit to the area and the use of this structure can be used by all
including walkers, casual bike riders,the elderly and the  incapacitated,
Mums and Dads and their children whether in prams or on bikes with training
wheels, and all those who just stroll and take in the delightful scenery and
atmosphere. Perhaps some of the opponents may also enjoy the area ever so
much more.
       <br />
       Lets stop this dilly dallying and move on !!!!!!!

       My name is Mark Wotherspoon - I don't have the option of walking, running or riding for exercise.  I have to use a wheelchair.
       <br />
       I regularly use and enjoy the existing Oceanway between Snapper Rocks and Bilinga Surf Clubs.
       <br />
       When I reach Bilinga Surf Club, I come to the end of the pathway.  I have to stop there because the 1.7km of public road reserve along the foreshore, Bilinga to Tugun, is not suitable for wheelchair travel.
       <br />
       Only walkers, runners and mountain bikes can use this public road reserve.
       <br />
       The footpath on Golden Four Drive is a disgrace and impossible to use in a wheelchair (I have tried).  I would not even attempt to use Golden Four Drive as in my experienced opinion it is far too dangerous.
       <br />
       Our Gold Coast Councillor, Chris Robbins, seems to think that disabled people should be able to use Golden Four Drive, now and in the future, where we must be viligant for cars exiting from the 65 driveways, negotiate impossible road crossing ramps and breathe in the pollution from cars, trucks and buses of the Gold Coast Highway.
       <br />
       In October 2012, council resolved to remove illegal encroachments from the Tugun to Bilinga public road reserve.  It is, I understand, their legal responsibility to maintain public road reserves to an acceptable standard for all users.
       <br />
       Clearly council has not provided equitable access here and I quote from the Engineering Services Committee meeting on October 11, 2012, adopted at council meeting October 23, 2012 - "Item 9.  Risk management number 8 ... Access along the 1.7km of beachfront public road reserve does not currently meet the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.  Whilst the removal of type A and B encroachments will improve accessibility for many people, the road reserve will still not provide disability compliant access in accordance with the DDA."
       <br />
       Why am I and other disabled persons treated like second-class citizens?
       <br />
       Why are others able to enjoy walking along the foreshore?
       <br />
       Where is the truth on council website that states that the Oceanway is a disability project?
       <br />
       And where is the truth on this website where the council states that they have an Accessible and Inclusive Action Plan 2014 - 2019?
       <br />
       I call on the chief executive of GCCC to take immediate action to rectify this totally unacceptable and discriminatory situation by committing to complete the Tugun to Bilinga section of the Oceanway - NOW!

       Transparency and credibility is needed from Gold Coast City Council for the ocean front walkway decision.
       <br />
       Unless you live adjacent to the public land on the ocean front between Bilinga and Tugun, you will most likely be in favour of completing the missing link of walkway and you will also believe that the consultation used by council to decide to divert the walkway onto Golden Four Drive is flawed at best and farcical at worst.
       <br />
       I have asked the mayor if my support for the walkway and my correspondence to the council were registered, with no satisfactory response.
       <br />
       People need to formally register support for completion of the walkway.
       <br />
       Council should have a transparent and credible procedure in place for decision making including registering all written opinions and using up-to-date statistics.
       <br />
       Council can then produce evidence to justify and support a transparent, ethical and credible decision.
       <br />
       Decisions made using a legitimate methodology, made available to the public for scrutiny, are more likely to be accepted by the community.
       <br />
       Intelligent people expect nothing less.
       <br />
       Council should be professional and responsible enough to demonstrate that they are listening to the entire community about decisions that affect us and the use of our public land.

       Many years ago, when the Oceanway was first proposed by Gold Coast City Council, I was approached to provide the views of local cyclists, walkers and other athletes.
       <br />
       In my role as co-ordinator of Bicycle Gold Coast, I canvassed the opinions of our members and others.  There was an enthusiastic and unanimous support for this exciting proposal.  I submitted a letter of support and copies of that letter were sent to the Councillor (Div 14) and Jann Stuckey.
       <br />
       I find it beyond belief that any claim might now be made that contradicts the previous views of such a wide cross-section of the community.
       <br />
       The role of our local councillor, and Gold Coast City Council, is to maintain and enhance the local amenities, i.e., the pleasantness of the place for all ratepayers, residents and guests.
       <br />
       Any suggestion that the original proposal will be degraded to the ugly alternative along Golden Four Drive is unthinkable.
       <br />
       I remember reading that, in her own defence, our local councillor claimed that GCCC refused to enter into any controversial decisions that might result in litigation.  I suspect that this is a bogus fear.
       <br />
       Would the beachfront residents really attempt to make a legal claim over public land?
       <br />
       Can I claim the bit of park that runs along my house?

       What recourse does a local community have when their elected representative fails to work in their best interests, appears to buckle to the pressure of a privileged few at the expense of the majority and puts out seemingly false and misleading information to confuse and confound meaningful discussion?

       I want to be able to walk along this section admiring the view of the ocean NOT a view of the very busy Gold Coast Highway. Gold Coast City Council was given a grant of $2.3M plus allocated funds for it in October 2011. It is now May, 2015 and I'd like to know where the funds are for this. It should have been built years ago.

       I'm signing because I think it is public space and needs to be open to all. Golden Four Drive is unsafe for cycling. Bicycle riding needs more infrastructure to increase public use and reduce traffic, parking and pollution. More people would utilise the area if the ocean way included the 1.7 km Tugun to Bilinga

       Renton Winders in the Sun (23/5), you are simply wrong and your arguments don't stack up.  Gold Coast City Council Engineering report on the concept states that the build of the Bilinga-Tugun Oceanway section is feasible and not problematic as you claim.
       <br />
       As to cost, the 2011 report says it would cost less than $4m, $2.5m to build the path and $1.5m in contingencies, design and managing the build.  The only reason it is not happening is because Councillor Chris Robbins has repeatedly blocked the building of the path, specially introducing motions in council meetings to successfully stymie it.
       <br />
       So unless Cr Robbins is voted out next year, the path will never be built.
       <br />
       This path is not just for locals but for all the Coast residents and for tourists from far and near.  It would be great for residents and small business in the area.
       <br />
       As for dune care, the dozen "private" paths running from the back of properties to the beach through the dunes clearly speak of selfishness and not of "care for the environment" and so do the private structures built on public land that remain in various states of disrepair.
       <br />
       Your nimby enviro warrior act is hollow.  Most people are not upset with the residents involved wanting to protect their privileged position, they get it.  The way that they try to maintain this privilege is what gets up most people's craw.  This path needs to be built along the foreshore where it belongs.  The more this is resisted, the more fractured our community will become.

       It is disappointing to once again see the Gold Coast City Council ignore the wishes of the greater community in favour of an easier option!
       <br />
       I continue to read opinion letters where disgruntled locals are simply after answers as to why the walkway from Bilinga to Tugun will not be constructed.  It is quite clear that consultation was sought from only the very few.
       <br />
       This is a community who welcomes visitors from all over the country and at the recent surf lifesaving national titles, the commute between the beach and water events (at North Kirra) and the surfboat arena (at Tugun) involved a death-defying cycle/walk along Golden Four Drive.
       <br />
       Why build a walkway from Rainbow Bay to North Kirra, and not beyond?  Is it for the sake of a few homeowners (likely rental accomodation)?
       <br />
       Are we not living in a society currently suffering from obesity and other issues derived from lack of exercise and healthy living?
       <br />
       This pathway encourages lifestyle changes that directly combat this continuous battle for our younger generations.  I personally would not want my grandchildren cycling their bikes along the main highway, sucking the fumes from exhaust pipes.  I am sure the local health professionals would agree with me!
       <br />
       Wake up Gold Coast City Council and do what the people voted you in to do....the right thing by all.

       I believe this section of Oceanway needs to be completed to provide equitable access to the beach in this area. Council has pandered to selfish land holders along this stretch of beach, without consideration for the overwhelming number of rate payers and visitotrs who deserve to be have paved access for wheelchairs, mobility scooters, prams, bicycles and those who have difficulty walking on uneven surfaces.

       Public land is for public use. The Gold Coast Council needs to be embracing this ocean pathway as a vital tourist and local amenity.

       Its a beautiful spot to walk along. To connect all the pathways up makes so much sense. Would love to be able to go from Currumbin to Coolangatta -as would most people! Not detouring via busy GF Drive
