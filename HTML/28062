    <p>
     <strong>
      Successes
     </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Provision of connecting pathways between destinations allowing tourists and residents to make more trips via walking and cycling.
      </strong>
     </li>
     <li>
      Increasing numbers of people able to enjoy sustainable journeys.
     </li>
     <li>
      Ongoing Council investment and recognition of the value of the movement network and need for ongoing upgrades.
     </li>
     <li>
      Converting two-way streets with narrow and uneven footpaths to one-way streets with improved and widened pavements has allowed greater walking and cycling use.
     </li>
     <li>
      Provision of hard surface pathways has allowed elederly residents and others with low mobility to access beaches that were previously unaccessible due to the difficulty of traversing soft sands.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Learnings
     </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Build it and they will come. By building more generous pathways for pedestrians and cyclists, non-motorised transport useage explodes. There is pent up demand for more sustainable behaviours which can be addressed by investing in green infrastructure.
      </strong>
     </li>
     <li>
      The contrast between a normal footpath and an Oceanway in terms of usage behaviours is even more dramatic than between a road with many intersections and a freeway. People appreciate immensely the ability to walk in a constant alignment and pace without having to step over driveways, service lids, cross streets and bus stops. Normal footpaths removes 80% of potential traffic conflicts in comparison with an Oceanway standard right of way which has zero cross conflicts.
     </li>
     <li>
      Intersection detail for the Oceanway is critical. There is a need to respect ease of alongshore movement in changes made to individual sections and public space. For the Oceanway share of travel to grow overall, the regional nature of the corridor needs to be respected in each local area masterplan.

      Disability Projects - Oceanway
     </h3>
     <p>
      Council has a proactive program to ensure that its 36 kilometres oceanway network is accessible to people with disabilities.
      <br />
      The beaches and watercycle infrastructure section of Council has a long-term project which aims to establish the oceanway as an international tourism attraction where people with disabilities can enjoy the Gold Coast coastline.
      <br />
      The project involves constructing wide, even and connecting pathways; upgrading or building accessible facilities such as parking; toilets and viewing platforms; providing accessible outdoor furniture such as picnic tables and water fountains; and improving lighting.

         The Tugun to Bilinga (T2B) Oceanway will connect the existing Oceanway paths that end at Bilinga SLSC and O'Connor Park, near the Tugun SLSC. This 1.7km section would lead to approximately 8km of continuous beachfront Oceanway stretching from Flat Rock Creek, Currumbin to Snapper Rocks in Coolangatta. The extension of a beachfront Oceanway - allowing access to this amenity for all members of the public including those with disabilities, the infirm, and the very young and elderly - will have numerous social and economic benefits for the Southern Gold Coast.

         Council's 2011 Planning Report clearly marked out an alignment (route) for the path which is predominantly on public land on the Pacific Parade road reserve, on the landward side of the dune system and seawall (also called the

          A-Line wall

         Council's proposed path alignment is predominantly on the Pacific Parade road reserve which is on the inland, western side of the dunes and seawall. For some of the more narrower sections, alternate walkway structures may be required, for example wooden walkways, which have been installed at multiple locations around the Australian coastline, and would be a far better alternative to the tracks that currently are gouged out of the mid-dune system (eg. John Street) in order to get around these "pinch points".

         With acknowledgement of the efforts made by a dune care group in one small patch of the dunes at the bottom of Sea Street and council's weed management efforts, there is clear evidence that much of the dune system has been left to degrade over the years.  A recent assessment showed that almost all of the dune system was overgrown by multiple varieties of invasive weed species and introduced plants.  Additionally, in some areas residents have  encroached into the dune system with lawn area. Council’s own Planning Scheme  Policy 15, which outlines the management regime for Coastal Dune Areas, states  that mown turf does not have the ability to trap windblown sand travelling  above the ground level, and this regime is not sustainable, and is not  considered acceptable long term. “To allow the land to be maintained as private  property, without an approved or monitored management regime will reduce the  natural heritage values of the ocean front land and would be detrimental to the  sustainability of other dunal environment”
         <a target="_parent" href="Images/report/dune_plants_12_policy_15.pdf">
          (Policy 15 – Management of Coastal  Dune Areas)
         </a>
         . Additionally, numerous beach access tracks have been made by  residents increasing the possibility of erosion, and the dunes are a dumping  ground for garden clippings and prunings, general rubbish such as plastics and  bottles, various items of disused infrastructure such as stair rails, and large  pieces of household equipment (eg. a canoe). We believe the most effective way  to improve the health of the dune system along this stretch of coast is to open  up access to allow protection, ownership and stewardship of the dunes that run  along it with support from community groups.

         It is true that council's preferred path alignment would require the cutting back or removal of some native trees, but all efforts would be made to keep this to a minimum.  Wherever possible these trees, mainly pandanus, may be transplanted.  Replacement trees can be planted and grown back, but everyone would of course prefer that tree removal is kept to a minimum.  As the path alignment is predominantly on the developed road reserve there can be zero to minimal impact expected to native fauna.  It should be noted there was no mention of fauna/native animal species in the council's Tugun to Bilinga Planning Report.  Overall there may be a very small impact on the environment during the construction of the T2B Oceanway in return for a far greater, longer term environmental gain (together with a significant increase in social, health and economic values).

          Consultation Report
         </a>
         released in May 2012.  However the report itself said:
         <br />
         <br />
         <blockquote>
          <em>
           <strong>
            "The consultation process did not focus on a random sample of respondents.  Instead, the feedback process enabled community members who reside, or own property, in proximity to the proposed Oceanway and accessway improvements an opportunity to provide extensive feedback to the proposals.
           </strong>
          </em>
          "
         </blockquote>
         This alone calls into question the validity of the survey and its findings.  Expert independent analysis of this survey also seriously questions its outcomes, finding the survey:
         <br />
         <br />
         <blockquote>
          <em>
           <strong>
            "DID NOT COMPLY with the normal standards of statistical riqour, independence and transparency necessary to justify rejection of the Oceanway proposal",  and that "the method was neither random nor representative but biased in favour of a small stakeholder group of Golden Four Drive beachfront residents who overwhelmingly oppose the proposal".
           </strong>
          </em>
         </blockquote>
         <br />
         In short, the survey results are not to be trusted.

         As it is now, Golden Four Drive is an unsuitable route for  pedestrians, let alone people on bikes, in wheelchairs or in prams, or the  elderly. It is well-used by cars, there are numerous driveway and street  crossings coming out onto the road, and the footpath is narrow, bumpy and full  of obstacles such as overhanging tree branches and bus shelters. Council’s own  advice says that, “The alternate current facilities along Golden Four Drive are  substandard and are not conducive to encouraging people to walk and cycle for  more trips and encourage healthier and more sustainable transport choices from  coastal residents and visitors” (
         <a href="Images/report/council_20131212.pdf">
          Adopted Report, December 2013
         </a>
         ). Main  Roads and Transport has started a project to upgrade Golden Four Drive in  sections over a number of years, and there is provision for a cycleway and  access path in these plans. However not all cyclists are comfortable riding on  the roadside, and it still is likely to leave pedestrians and other users  having to cross roads and/or possible driveway points. Then there are the  amenity and health aspects of using a path which runs along a busy road compared  with a dedicated and safe beachside path. Additionally, there are technical  issues involved with upgrading Golden Four Drive such as moving infrastructure  and reduced car parking space.

         While T2B Oceanway does pose challenges in terms of policies and regulations, these were investigated by the council’s  Infrastructure Development Group using the resources of Legal Services, City  Governance. No major legal impediments were noted in council’s Tugun to Bilinga  Oceanway Planning Report. In fact council has reported that the only reason the  Oceanway link between  Tugun-Bilinga was put on hold was “a result of the current economic conditions”
