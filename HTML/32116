    Chapter #12 - Settling Disputes
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   <img width="270" vspace="0" hspace="10" height="370" border="0" align="RIGHT" alt="TENNIS INSTRUCTION" src="images/tennis-instruction.gif" />
   You
    will have disputes on the court. I said earlier that it's important 
   to be fair rather than nice, but now I want to discuss with you what 
   goes on inside your head in relation to disputes.  If you are 
   having a dispute (they are not fun and they are unpleasant) I want 
   you to make sure that one dispute does not distract you from complete 
   focus on succeeding points. I want you to make sure that you resolve 
   the dispute in your own mind and you are ready to play the next 
   point.  If that means bouncing the ball eight, ten, twelve times 
   before you start up the next point, fine.  If that means taking 
   a short little walk, fine. Do whatever you need to do to resolve the 
   dispute in your mind and play on from there.
  </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   If you've made a bad call, admit it and say, "I'm sorry.  I 
   made a bad call.  The ball was in. It's your point."  
   I don't want that one point to cause you from having a guilty 
   conscientious for the next two hours.  It's better to say, 
   "Gee, I really made a mistake. It's your point."  Then 
   your conscience is clear and you can play on from there.  If 
   you've called the ball out and you're sure it's out, well, stay with 
   it.  Your conscience is clear, and it should not matter to you 
   if they're jumping up and down and threatening your life.  If 
   your conscience is clear and the ball was out, the ball was out. 
    Don't let their problem become your problem.  If they think you 
   are cheating, that's their problem.  You know in your heart you 
   are not cheating.  It's not your problem.
  </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Make sure before you start the next point that your mind is 
   clear.  Even if you decide in your mind that you have just 
   gotten ripped off, that your opponent and the officials have robbed 
   you of a point, or robbed you of a game, resolve in your mind that 
   you have just gotten ripped off and now you are ready to play from 
   there on.  Don't keep going back to that one point and say, 
   "If I had only gotten that one point," because then you are 
   distracting yourself from the task.
  </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   One point does not a match make (unless, of course, it's the last 
   point!). But don't let one dispute on one point carry over for the 
   next two hours.
  </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   You're only going to have disputes maybe twenty percent of the time. 
   It's normal.  People have disputes.  Some people handle 
   them well.  Some people handle them poorly.  Your ability 
   to handle those disputes will help you to win more matches.
  </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Make sure you're ready to play, and then play on totally focussed.
