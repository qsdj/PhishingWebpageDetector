      China is a water scarce country. Although it has vast aggregate reserves of freshwater, nearly 2700km3, it is quite dry on a per capita basis, with availability of only around 2000 cubic meters per person per year, less than a third the global average. However, this already ominous national figure obscures the dramatic hydrological imbalances between China’s regions. 80% of the country’s freshwater resources are located in the south and, while the country’s mountainous southwest provinces enjoy resources in excess of 25,000m3/p/y, parts of the country’s arid north survive on less than 500m3/p/y.
      <br />
      <br />
      Such imbalances do not inexorably lead to catastrophe if they serve as a guide for the location of human settlement and activities. The logic of China’s urban growth, unfortunately, is unaffected by the distribution of its hydrological resources. The water rich south mentioned above is one of the country’s thinly populated regions while the arid north is the site of a group of ever expanding mega-cities, extractive and manufacturing industries that use and waste vast quantities of water, and huge intensively and inefficiently irrigated agricultural regions. China’s freshwater resources will only come under increasing stress in the coming years. The global face of rapid development for the last two decades, China is actually set to redouble its efforts, as the incoming administration places urbanization at the center of an economic agenda that they believe will move the country towards a consumption-driven economy.
      <br />
      <br />
      Sited within a massively irrigated agricultural district in China’s arid north, this project offers a series of operational and typological interventions that together provide a vision for development in the face of the Yellow River Watershed’s increasingly severe water shortages. An initial reduction of the district’s water usage provides the opportunity to propose a recalibration and reinvention of local economies and settlement patterns better suited both to the dry future that awaits this particular part of China, and the watershed’s broader usage and scarcity dynamics.
