        <strong>
         MANAGING CLIENTS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Niucap manages client exposures by tactically diversifying funds into different markets and assets classes, such as cash, fixed interest, equities, properties and international investment exposures by ensuring clients' portfolios are invested in the right markets at the right time. We ensure clients exposures to the various risks in the financial markets in the financial markets are optimally managed and are appropriate to the current economic climate by moving assets we consider likely to under-perform to investments which are expected to deliver strong returns over-time.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
         Cash &amp; Fixed interest Investments
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Objective: To ensure liquidity, capital stability and protection against inflation and classified as low to medium risk and providing a fair return commensurate with market rates and risk premium.
        <br />
        <br />
        Approach:
        <br />
        Niucap actively manages On Call Cash Deposits and Fixed Term Investments by conducting bespoke research, monitoring market trends and advising clients accordingly. With a deep understanding of the key trends, we are in the best position to anticipate likely movements in interest rates and our advice extends to hedging against inflation and market interest rate risk. In order to optimize investment value, Niucap undertakes strategic bidding on behalf of clients at the regular Bank of Papua New Guinea Treasury Bill and Inscribed stock auctions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Risk Management:
        <br />
        Niucap, in consultation with clients, will determine the appropriate liquidity requirements, which extends from identified and approved project costs coverage to demographics (such as project cash requirement profiles).
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
         Equities
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Objective: To provide a steady income stream and capital growth over the long term, and includes both domestic and international stocks (i.e. dual-listed on the port moresby stock Exchange and the Australian stock Exchange).
        <br />
        <br />
        Approach:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Niucap's investment modelling and analysis capabilities are complemented by the technology platform offered under the strategic alliance with the Macquarie Private wealth
        </li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Our research capabilities are benchmarked on our ability in delivering detailed due diligence on company fundamentals drawing from our own pool of market database and information
        </li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Our strategic alliance with Macquarie Private Wealth provides Niucap the leverage to select from a vast database of potential international investments and fund managers
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Risk Management:
        <br />
        <br />
        Niucap individually reviews each company and clients' total portfolios using qualitative and quantitative analysis and portfolio construction methods to maintain to minimise "downside" risk.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
         Property
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Objective: ToÂ  capture higher than average long term yields within the PNG property market.
        <br />
        <br />
        Approach:
        <br />
        <br />
        Niucap is constantly and actively sourcing the property market for potential investments that offer good long term yields and sound long trem occupancy rates. In addition, many excellent opportunities are brought to our offices through our extensive local network, which include local Real Estate Agents and Valuers and other professionals who provide valuable input relating to individual properties and property market trends.
        <br />
        One of the benefits of specialised property Managers include timely property management benchmarking against market trends and development based on up-to-date market information database.
        <br />
        Niucap's approach is to facilitate a "market of properties" (all property is local), not a "property market". Niucap is fortunate to have two very experienced propertyÂ  investors and managers, who can assist clients with all aspects of their property investments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Risk Management:
       </p>
       <p>
        Having the correct (mix of) tenants is very strategic to income producing properties, and Niucap leverages off its due diligence experience to assess potential tenants. Similarly, having pre-sales is key to successful property development, and Niucap uses its broad network to help clients succeed.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs)
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Objective: SPVs are usually created for a specific objective, and can help the parent entity minimise numerous risks, and increase capacity for financing
        <br />
        <br />
        Risk Management:
       </p>
       <p>
        SPVs legally isolate a high risk project/asset from the parent entity to allow other investors to take a share of the investment risk.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
