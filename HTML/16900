     Frequently Asked Questions
    </h2>
    <ul>
     <li>
      How much does this service cost?
      <br />
      It is completely free.
     </li>
     <li>
      Can I help somehow?
      <br />
      The active portion of this project is now over, so other than reading the content
                there isn't much left to do.
     </li>
     <li>
      What about copyrights?
      <br />
      The pages on reocities.com, except for the pages related to reocities.com itself
                are all (C) by their respective creators, just like every other bit of 
                content on the internet, we simply host it, just like geocities did in the past.
     </li>
     <li>
      You are making money of my content!, I will sue you!
      <br />
      First of all, no, I'm not making money of your content, it actually costs money
                to host this service, but I can afford it. Think of it as a public service.
                The ads that are there are but a small drop in the bucket and for a long long time
                there weren't any ads at all (the ads basically point visitors to the company
                that has paid for this project).
      <br />
      As for suing me, that is always possible. But if all you want is for me to take
                down your pages (assuming they really are yours!) all you have to do is to use the
      <a href="selfservice.html">
       Self Service Tools
      </a>
      and your pages will be removed
                at the first opportunity.
      <br />
      And then there is a peculiar thing I have with lawsuits and threats, it brings out
                the worst in me. All of a sudden I go from friendly and cooperative to very very
                stubborn. Anybody that threatens to sue will find out that I am completely not
                impressed, and that you will then actually have to sue in order to get your way.
      <br />
      This is annoying, because it will cost you lots of money, and in the end will only
                achieve - assuming you follow through on your threat - the exact same thing that
                you could have achieved by using the automated tools.
      <br />
     </li>
     <li>
      Will you remove my content?
      <br />
      If any of this stuff is yours, and you do not want their your old geocities.com 
                content to live on in this way then please use the
      <a href="selfservice.html">
       Self Service Tools
      </a>
      ,
                and your content will be removed within 30 days.
      <b>
       Make sure you include the URL
                of your pages!
      </b>
      If you think of being rude or threatening
                then please see above. Running reocities.com has cost a lot of money and I refuse
                to be yelled at for a public service, even if I can understand that you feel strange
                about someone copying *your* data without your permission. If you want to know more
                about the reasons for that I suggest you read the 'making of' page.
      <br />
      Reocities was and is a labour of love, I highly doubt I will ever recover the money
                that has gone in to it, but I'm not complaining.
      <br />
      If you have requested a removal of your content, (or even if you haven't) please
                be aware that there are other parties that may have your content backed up.
     </li>
     <li>
      Can you help me find my page, it's gone?
      <br />
      If your page has not appeared yet then don't despair, there is still some hope.
      <br />
      A lot of parties have worked together to back up as much of geocities as possible.
                Even if your pages have not yet been restored keep at it, google is your friend.
                If they have been backed up, sooner or later they should re-appear in google.
      <br />
      One simple way to be alerted that your pages have been found is to go to the
                old web address you had on geocities but change the 'g' in to an 'r'. That puts
                you on a page with a simple form that you can fill out, it will be used to 
                alert you if and when that page has been found.
      <br />
      There is also a 1 terabyte torrent floating around on the internet with lots of
                geocities content.
     </li>
     <li>
      Can you send me a backup of my pages?
      <br />
      Yes, absolutely. In fact, this is a request that is repeated so often that I've
                included a module in the
      <a href="selfservice.html">
       Self Service Tools
      </a>
      , so 
                feel free to help yourself! 

		After you've received your backed-up copy of your old site you can then use this to build a new 
                website or for safekeeping.
     </li>
     <li>
      Can I edit my page?
      <br />
      Unfortunately I do not have a way to edit the pages yet, apologies. The reasons why
                are both complex (how to make sure spammers don't hijack your account?) and simple
		(I don't have a lot of free time).
