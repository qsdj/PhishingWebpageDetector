         The amount we pay you depends on several different factors.

         First let's describe the amount you earn per click and for each of your referral's clicks depending on the type of membership you have and the type of the exposed advertisement:

        What is a referral?
       </div>
       <div class="faq_answer">
        <p>
         Referrals are users like you who have registered in KayAds.
         <br />
         There are two types of referrals:
         <br />
         <strong>
          Direct Referrals:
         </strong>
          These users registered using your username as their referrer.
         <br />
         <strong>
          Rented Referrals:
         </strong>
          These users registered without a referrer. You can rent them.

        What is AutoPay?
       </div>
       <div class="faq_answer">
        <p>
         AutoPay is one way to extend your referrals automatically.
         <br />
         If you have AutoPay enabled, on the first click a referral makes per day, you'll pay to keep that referral for an extra day.
         <br />
         If the referral does not click, you won't pay him for another day.
         <br />
         In other words, you'll pay one day in advance to your referral's due date.
         <br />
         AutoPay is also cheaper for you because you save 15% of a whole month's rent.
         <br />
         The value for each referral/day will be deducted from your rental balance.
         <br />
         If your rental balance has insufficient funds, it will deduct from your main balance.
         <br />
         If both balances have insufficient funds, it won't be triggered and will only work again when one of the balances has enough funds.
         <br />
         <em>
          Note: Please keep in mind that while you may have AutoPay activated, it's only triggered for referrals that have 20 or more days left until the next payment.

        What are Paid To Signup offers (PTSU)?
       </div>
       <div class="faq_answer">
        <p>
         Paid To Signup offers are adverts where you must register with our advertiser website and provide proof that you actually completed the offer successfully and followed the instructions completely.
         <br />
         <br />
         The advertiser will specific the exact terms of the offer.
         <br />
         <br />
         You must read and understand the terms and then complete the offer as required.
         <br />
         When you submit the offer then the advertiser will have 7 days to approve the offer or deny the offer.
         <br />
         <br />
         If the advertiser approves the offer then the money will automatically be credited to your account.
         <br />
         If the advertiser denies the offer then you will not be paid.
         <br />

         <br />
         - Please do not post any offer where our members need to make a purchase or upgrade.
         <br />
         - Please do not post an offer where the member cannot reasonably complete the offer within a 24 hours time period.
