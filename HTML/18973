        Consultant works with many  leasing companies nationwide they can help you determine if leasing your  equipment is right for your business. If you should decide to lease, they can  usually get the
        <a target="_self" href="registration.php">
         equipment you need
        </a>
        with just a simple, one page credit  application. In many cases they can have the new equipment on site in as little  as a few days.

        Equipment Lease &amp; Loans
       </h2>
       <p>
        In addition to the initial cost and obsolescence, leasing  your equipment can also provide your business with a substantial tax advantage.  While you should always consult with your tax advisor first,
        <a target="_self" href="registration.php">
         most equipment  leases can be structured
        </a>
        so that you can write off 100% of the annual lease  payments. By contrast, current tax laws only allow a business to write off the  interest paid on loans. However, because a lease is a rental and the business  is only using the equipment, the business can usually write off all of the  monthly lease payments just like any other legitimate business expense. Once  again, this can result in thousands of additional dollars in working
        <a target="_self" href="registration.php">
         capital being  put back into your business
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The last major advantage of leasing your equipment instead  of buying is that leasing allows you to not show the equipment on your balance  sheet. Once again, this is because the equipment is being rented and therefore  actually belongs to a different company than the one that is using it. For this  reason leases are often referred to as "off balance sheet" financing  and this can be a tremendous advantage to many businesses both large and small.
        <a target="_self" href="registration.php">
         Big businesses prefer this option
        </a>
        because they don't want to own millions of  dollars in equipment. This equipment will depreciate substantially with the  day-to-day usage. Whoever owns the equipment is responsible for the  depreciation on their balance sheet. Also, large corporations may require that  the board of directors approve any new loans to the business. This can  make it difficult for the management of the business to operate efficiently.  But a lease is not a loan and therefore may not require approval by the board  for the managers to get the equipment they need. In smaller businesses this can  also be an advantage because they will not show additional debt on the balance  sheet that will affect their ability to borrow money in the future. If you are  considering selling your business, this may also make your company more  attractive to potential buyers since you will be showing less debt on the  balance sheet.

        Frequently,  a commercial bank cannot provide all the loan funds a growing company needs. A  balance sheet is not liquid enough, or it can't clear off the bank debt every 6  or 12 months.
        <a target="_self" href="registration.php">
         A factor can provide funds to clear off bank loans
        </a>
        periodically  or make additional bank credit possible by guaranteeing accounts or replacing  accounts receivables with cash. One of the biggest advantages of factoring is that
        <a target="_self" href="registration.php">
         businesses get immediate cash
        </a>
        (from 70 -80% of the face value of the invoices)  within 24-48 hours, which means you can accelerate your cash flow by speeding  up payment of the receivables. You will have an immediate source of funds for  operating expenses and future growth. You will be able to use your own, hard  earned cash without having to wait 30, 60, 90 or 120 days to collect from  customers. Additionally, since only receivables are used as collateral for the  cash advance, other assets (such as real estate and equipment) can be used for  future borrowing.

        Cash flow is probably the
        <a target="_self" href="registration.php">
         most important element in the  success of a business
        </a>
        . Accounts receivables may be the biggest asset on a  company's balance sheet. They also represent the business' best source of  operating capital that is in permanent disuse. Factoring improves cash flow. A  business can use cash currently tied up in receivables to increase sales and  take advantage of supplier discounts.
        <a target="_self" href="registration.php">
         Factoring accelerates cash flow by  eliminating the time lag between the delivery of goods or the performance of a  service
        </a>
        and the payment for it. Most businesses have to pay their expenses  before they can collect their receivables, disrupting cash flow.
