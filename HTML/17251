               <br />
               The Annapurna is Nepal’s most popular trekking area. It’s not hard to see why. Spectacular scenery, diverse cultures, forests, lakes and glaciers combine to make it one of the most scenic areas for novice or experienced trekkers. The Annapurna were the first mountains over 8000m to be climbed. The accommodation is mostly of a high standard in teahouses, and you can trek in relative style and comfort.

You drive along the Kathmandu-Pokhara Highway to Dumre and then follow the narrow and paved road by the Marsyangdi Khola to Besi Sahar (823m.). It takes almost 6 hours. Beshishahar is the district headquarters of Lamjung district. All the local government offices are situated here.

You can enjoy the sceneries and the local culture of Gurung community. Here you walk through the rice terrace fields with the good views of various mountains.

                <br />
                Trek from Bahundanda to Jagat (1800m.) and it takes about six hours. A steep trail ascends from Nagdi, through rice terraces, before crossing a stream at the bottom of a small waterfall. It then climbs again and traverses the hillside high above the river before reaching the village of Lili Gaon. Ahead, the Marsyangdi valley forms a steep V-shape, and you follow the winding mountain path down through Syange and along the river for some distance. The trail then climbs steeply and the path is cut into the sheer cliff-face some 200-300m above the riverbed. Eventually you descend to the stone village of Jagat, situated on a shelf, which juts into the precipitous Marsyangdi valley. You stay overnight at tea house (lodge).

                <br />
                Trek from Jagat to Dharapani (1943m.) which takes about six hours. The trail from Jagat descends until it almost reaches the river and then begins to climb again through a forest. The sheer cliff on the opposite bank plunges downward but this side is also steep. When the climb ends, you follow a level track to Chyamje, which is marked by a magnificent waterfall on the opposite bank. After descending to the river and crossing a suspension bridge, you begin a climb to Sattale on a path so steep that it seems one slip would send you hurtling down into the valley. You continue on an undulating path above the river, and at one point, where a tributary flows in from the opposite bank, the main river becomes covered with huge boulders that hide the water. Climbing the zigzag path to the top of the hill, you see the level, plain of Taal before us. Though it is enclosed by cliffs, the level area looks reassuring after the harrowing mountain paths just traveled on. You descend to a grassy riverbank that leads to Taal with its hotels and teahouses. Here you can enjoy the exhilarating water fall. Beyond Taal, the valley narrows and the path becomes high and winding, and in several areas hewn from the rock itself. Beyond the small village of Karte, there is a bit more cliff-walking before the path drops again to the river. You cross a suspension bridge, and climb the short distance to the stone kani marking the entrance to Dharapani, and your camp for the night.

                <br />
                Trek from Dharapani to Chame (2713m.).which takes about four hours. As you cut through a narrow field from the village, the Dudh Khola, which originates from the south face of Manaslu, enters on the opposite bank. The Marsyangdi then veers to the left, and as Annapurna II becomes visible ahead, you arrive at Bagarchhap, a Bhote village with prayer flags fluttering in the breeze. Continuing to climb through forests of pine and oak, you pass through Dhanakyu before coming to a thundering waterfall. Further, the Marsyangdi Khola enters a gorge and the path consists of steep stone steps. Pausing for breath, you can look back for views of Manaslu. When the steep incline ends, you follow a path amid magnificent rhododendrons to Ratamron and then continue on a gently rising path, crossing a stream before entering a pine forest. You then cut across a loose hillside to the hamlet of Kotho from where you can look straight up at nearby Annapurna II - a sight convincing us that you are deep in the Himalayan mountains! From here the trail climbs through a fir and pine forest to Chame where there are government offices, shops, and hotels. Chame is the administrative headquarters for the Manang district.

                Trek from Chame to Pisang (3155m.) and it takes about five hours. With Lamjung Himal [6893m] sparkling in the morning sun, you set off for Pisang. The mountain disappears as you climb the path up the valley, passing a huge apple orchard. You continue through a fir and pine forest, climbing to a high, rocky area as the opposite bank becomes an impassable cliff. From this point, the valley becomes extremely steep-sided as you follow the path to Bratang. In the past this was the military station for troops who fought against the Khampa tribal revolution, but the dilapidated buildings are all that remain of that era. A short climb from the village brings you to a rock-strewn area where you cross a wooden bridge and follow a high, winding path, before crossing back to the right bank again. You now walk through a pine forest and as the forest ends, the valley changes from a V-shape to a gentle U-shape, opening up a wonderful vista before us. You can see the east peak of Annapurna II as well as Pisang Peak to the north-east. Continuing on, you come to a long Mani wall by a bridge and the lower village of Pisang.

                Trek from Pisang to Manang (3351m.) which takes about five hours. Beyond Pisang, the trail climbs a steep ridge, which affords good views of the Manang valley and Tilicho peak. Descending past Manang's airstrip at Hongde, you come to a level area from where the northeast face of Annapurna III rises majestically above you. From the wide plains of the Sabje Khola Valley, Annapurna IV [7525m] also becomes visible. Just beyond this point you cross the considerably reduced flow of the Marsyangdi Khola via a wooden bridge to the tiny village of Mungji. Cultivated fields appear on both sides of the path and off to the right, below a craggy mountain, you can see the village of Bryaga with its splendid monastery. Large chorten and mani walls abound and the tall peaks of the Himalaya spread out before us - Annapurna II, Annapurna III, Annapurna IV, Gangapurna [7455m] and, to the rear, Tilicho Peak [7134m]. After a short steep climb you reach Manang which is a surprisingly large village for this remote mountain region. You camp here for the night, amidst the fluttering prayer flags that adorn the houses.

You start early today for your crossing of Thorung La (5416m) The trail becomes steep immediately on leaving camp but as this trail has been used by local people for hundreds of years the path is well defined. The gradient then eases and after around 4 hours of steady climbing you reaches the chorten and prayer flags of the pass. The views are dramatic to say the least, from the snow-covered mountains above, to the head of the Kali Gandaki valley below and the brown and purple hills of Mustang which are spread out before us. The descent to Muktinath is a knee pounding 1600m but it's compensated for with excellent views of Dhaulagiri. Eventually the moraines give way to grassy slopes before a pleasant walk along the Jhong Khola Valley to Muktinath and its shrines and temple.
