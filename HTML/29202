          One of the most common types of accidents in the state of Pennsylvania is a car accident, especially on the busy roads of Pittsburgh and other urban areas. While some accidents aren’t serious and cause only minor damage to persons or vehicles, others are significantly more grave and in some cases, can even be fatal. Many car accidents require victims to undergo extensive medical procedures, including:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Life saving surgery
          </li>
          <li>
           Blood transfusions
          </li>
          <li>
           Bone grafts
          </li>
          <li>
           Skin grafts
          </li>
          <li>
           Nerve reconstruction
          </li>
          <li>
           Amputations
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Even after emergency medical care has been rendered, victims of car accidents may have to live with paralyzation, loss of cognitive function, chronic pain and emotional distress from the loss of a loved one.
         </p>
         <p>
